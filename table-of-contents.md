## 1. Design systems
 - The ever-shifting Web landscape and the need for modularity
 - History of modular design
 - Trends: style tiles, element collages, pattern libraries, UI frameworks
 - Advantages: promote consistency, establish a consistent vocabulary, create more robust deliverables, establish a system that can be modified and extended, future-friendly
 - Issues with UI frameworks and pattern libraries
 - Setting the stage for the need of a better methodology

## 2. Atomic Design Methodology
 - Set up the chemistry analogy (atoms are the building blocks of matter, those atoms combine to form molecules, etc)
 - Definition of atomic design: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages

### Atoms
  - Atoms definition: basic tags and other design elements that can't be broken down any further.
  - Atoms pros: establishes a shared vocabulary, see all interface styles abstracted at a glance, etc
  - Atoms challenges: too abstract to be useful, etc
  
### Molecules
  - Molecules definition: a group of atoms joined together to form a relatively simple module. For example, a label, input, and button atom joining together to form a search form molecule.
  - Molecule pros: do one thing and do it well, assemble rather than deconstruct, etc
  - Molecule challenges: Still fairly abstract, out of context, etc

### Organisms
  - Organisms definition: groups of molecules (and possibly atoms) joined together to form distinct section of an interface.
  - Organism pros: reusable interface components, more concrete than atoms and molecules, encourages portability, etc
  - Organism challenges: Still out of context, etc
 - Breaking the chemistry analogy to get into the deliverables language

### Templates
  - Templates definition: page-level documents that provide context for these relatively abstract molecules and organisms, and  focus on content structure
  - Templates pros: focus on content structure, can begin as wireframes and evolve over time, etc
  - Templates challenges: still an abstraction. FPO is not real content, etc

### Pages
  - Page definition: specific instances of a template. Replaces content structure with real representative content
  - Page pros: Tests the resiliency of the system, test variations in content structure, extremely concrete, it's what the client naturally ends up focusing on since it's what
  - Page considerations: Clients/colleagues can get distracted by representative content ("I don't like how I look in that photo") vs commenting on effectiveness of the design.
Atomic design summary: recap atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages
Discuss the advantages of atomic design, especially the ability to traverse between abstract and concrete

## 3. Tools of the Trade
- Pattern Lab, what and how
 - Getting started
 - Interface inventories
  - What interface inventories are and why they're effective
  - How to conduct an interface inventory
  - Stylify.me and Type-o-matic
  - Pattern library boilerplates, and front-end style guides
Process & Workflow
Getting buy-in from clients and colleagues
Working with atomic design in cross-disciplinary teams
Conclusion
Recap why systematic design is so important
