A long, long time ago, there were these things called _books_. Remember them? These contraptions were heavy and bulky and made of dead trees. Inside these books were things called _pages_. You turned them, and they cut your fingers.

Awful things. I’m so glad these book things and their razor-sharp pages aren’t around anymore.

Oh wait.

## Our Paginated Past
The _page_ has been with us for a long time now. A few millennia, actually. The first books were thick slabs of clay created about 2,000 years ago, which quickly replaced scrolls as the preferred way to consume the written word. *(note: footnote referring back to The Shallows)*. And while reading technology has come a long way – from parchment to paperback to pixels – the concept of the page holds strong to this day. 

The page metaphor has been baked into the lexicon of the Web since the very beginning. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web so that he, his colleagues at CERN, and other academics could easily share and link together their web of *documents*. This document-based, academic genesis of the Web is why the concept of the *page* is so deeply ingrained in the vocabulary of the internet.

So what? 

As we’ll discuss throughout this book, the way things are named very much impact how they’re perceived and utilized. Thinking of the Web as *pages* has real ramifications on how people interact with web experiences, and influences how we as an industry go about creating Web interfaces.

From the beginning, the page metaphor provided users with a familiar language for which to navigate this brave new World Wide Web. Concepts like bookmarking, pagination etc.

The page metaphor has had a profound influence on how web experiences are created.

In the early days of the Web, companies looking to get online simply translated their printed materials onto their websites. Viewing a website as simply a digital representation of the printed page was easy for people to wrap their hands around. Of course these brochure websites reflected a very one-dimensional perspective of what the Web could offer, but hey, it was a start.

“Brad, how long will the home *page* take to build?” Well, that sort of depends on what’s on it, right? Maybe the homepage consists of a tagline and a background image, which means it’ll be done by lunch. Or maybe it’s chock full of carousels, sophisticated forms, third-party integrations.

The page metaphor served its purpose helping users familiarize themselves with this new medium, and provided . But in order to create thoughtful Web experiences  the time to move away from the page metaphor.

## Tearing Up the Page

## Trends (note: need title)

Trends: style tiles, element collages, UI frameworks, pattern libraries, CSS architecture, not another redesign

## Design Systems Save the Day
Advantages of design systems: promote consistency, establish a consistent vocabulary, create more robust deliverables, establish a system that can be modified and extended, future-friendly
