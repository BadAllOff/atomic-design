Once upon a time in the not-so-distant past, there were these things called _books_. Remember them? These contraptions were heavy and bulky and made of dead trees. Inside these books were things called _pages_. You turned them, and they cut your fingers.

Awful things. I’m so glad these book things aren’t around anymore.

Oh wait.

## Our Paginated Past
The _page_ has been with us for a long time now. A few millennia, actually. The first books were thick slabs of clay created about 2,000 years ago, which quickly replaced scrolls as the preferred way to consume the written word. *(note: footnote referring back to The Shallows)*. And while reading technology has come a long way – from parchment to paperback to pixels – the concept of the page holds strong to this day. 

The notion of the page has been baked into the nomenclature of the Web since the very beginning. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web so that he, his colleagues at CERN, and other academics could easily share and link together their web of *documents*. This document-based, academic genesis of the Web is why the concept of the *page* is so deeply ingrained in the lexicon of the internet.

So what? 

As we’ll discuss throughout this book, the way things are named very much impact how they’re perceived and utilized. Thinking of the Web as pages has real ramifications on how people interact with web experiences and how we create interfaces.

In the early days of the Web, companies looking to get online simply translated their printed materials onto their websites. Viewing a website as simply a digital representation of the printed page was easy for people to wrap their hands around. Of course this led to a very one-dimensional

“Brad, how long will the home *page* take to build?” Well, that sort of depends on what’s on it, right? Maybe the homepage consists of a tagline and a background image, which means it’ll be done by lunch. Or maybe it’s chock full of carousels, sophisticated forms, third-party integrations.

Time to move away from the page metaphor
