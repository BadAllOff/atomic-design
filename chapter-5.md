And they made a design system, delivered a pattern library, and lived happily ever after. Right? 

Not quite.

There's a very real risk that a pattern library will be thrown in the trashcan right alongside all the PSDs, PDFs and other artifacts of the design process. All the time and effort that went into into making a thoughtful design system and pattern library goes down the drain.

Why does this happen?

> A style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an ecosystem. <cite>[Nathan Curtis](https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608)</cite>

An *artifact* is something you'd find in an archaeological dig or a museum, whereas a *system* is a living, breathing entity. A pattern library can provide helpful documentation, but the simple existence of a pattern library doesn't guarantee long-term success for the underlying design system. 
 
We've already discussed the importance of resetting everyone's expectations in order to establish a more collaborative, pattern-driven workflow. In order to make successful, lasting design systems, we must once again fundamentally rewire people's brains about the work we create.

## Changing minds, once again

### What are we making again?
We may *think* we primarily design and build websites. With this mental model, the website remains the primary focus of everyone's attention, while the pattern library is an offshoot of the website providing helpful documentation for the final product.

With this mentality, you can almost see that pattern library snapping off and fading into the abyss. **Once the pattern library ceases to reflect the current state of the live website, it becomes obsolete**. And once the pattern library managing the design system is no longer relevant, the maintenance process for the website devolves into a cluster of hotfixes and ad hoc changes, ruining all then thoughtfulness that went into creating   the original design system.

In order to successfully maintain a successful design system, we must fundamentally shift our mentality around just what it is weâ€™re creating. Rather than thinking our primary responsibility

Friction can be friendly.

### Done and done
One essential expectation to reset is the concept of *done*. Print and other physical mediums involve creating tangible objects that have a sense of finality to them. That simply doesn't exist in the digital world. The ephemeral nature of the Web means that changes can happen  is something that needs to be extolled to your clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. If we're to create living design systems, we need to recognize that the Web is never done, and that our work can and should be constantly evolved and improved upon over time.

## Maintainable Design Systems


### Make It Maintainable
- Don't let it die on the vine and become obsolete
- Sharing CSS and JS with the production environment is easy, but sharing templates is tough
- Templating language should match the production environment
- [Using Grunt with Pattern Lab](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/using-grunt-with-pattern-lab/)

## The holy grail
- Holy Grail is when the pattern library and production environment are perfectly in sync. Make a change to a pattern library, and anywhere the pattern is included in production will be updated.
- [Rizzo](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/) by Lonely Planet has accomplished this.

### Strategies for achieving the holy grail
- [Chasing the holy grail](https://medium.com/@marcelosomers/chasing-the-holy-grail-bbc0b7cce365#.vy45rkm7m)

## Make it cross-disciplinary
- Not just a developer tool. Not just a designer tool. Every discipline invested in the success of the website should be contributing to the pattern library.
- Carousel component example - amazingly complex component requiring input from business owners, editorial staff, content strategists, art directors, UX designers, front-end people, backend people

## Make it approachable
- No shocker here, but good design leads to more usage.
- Avoid exposing tons of code right out of the gate as it might discourage other disciplines from looking at it ("Oh this must not be for me")

## Make it visible
- Make it public.
- Recruitment, recruitment, recruitment.

### Make it agnostic
- The more agnostic pattern names are, the more versatile and reusable they become.
- Nicole Sullivan [media object](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)

### Make it contextual
- Demonstrate context. Where are
- Pattern Lab lineage

### Make it last
- Publish updates (Material Design example)
- Notifications - Regular E-mail newsletters, blog updates, etc, whenever things change, Slack integrations 
- Monitor progress - Lonely Planet performance

## Go forth and be atomic
