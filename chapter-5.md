And they made a design system, delivered a pattern library, and lived happily ever after. Right? 

Not quite.

There's a very real risk that a pattern library will be thrown in the trashcan right along with the PSDs, PDFs and other artifacts of the design process. All the time and effort that went into into making a thoughtful design system and pattern library goes down the drain.

Why does this happen?

> A style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an ecosystem. <cite>[Nathan Curtis](https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608)</cite>

An *artifact* is something you'd find in an archaeological dig or a museum, whereas a *system* is a living, breathing, kinetic entity. A pattern library provides helpful documentation, but simply making a pattern library doesn't guarantee long-term success. Pattern library
 
We've already discussed the importance of resetting everyone's expectations to create a pattern-driven, more collaborative workflow. In order to make successful, lasting design systems, we must once again fundamentally shift how people think about the work we create.

## Resetting expectations

### What are we making again?
We *think* we make websites. And that's partially true. But the issue with th

With this approach, the website remains the primary focus of attention. The pattern library is an offshoot of the website. But you can almost see that pattern library breaking off and fading into the abyss. This is what tends to happen without a fundamental shift in how we think about our longterm design process.

Rather than .One of the most fundamental shifts in how we think is around what it is we're building. The website becomes one instantiation of

### Done and done
One essential expectation to reset is the concept of *done*. Print and other physical mediums involve creating tangible objects that have a sense of finality to them. That simply doesn't exist in the digital world. The ephemeral nature of the Web means that changes can happen  is something that needs to be extolled to your clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. If we're to create living design systems, we need to recognize that the Web is never done, and that our work can and should be constantly evolved and improved upon over time.

## Maintainable Design Systems

### Make It Maintainable
- Don't let it die on the vine and become obsolete
- Sharing CSS and JS with the production environment is easy, but sharing templates is tough
- Templating language should match the production environment
- [Using Grunt with Pattern Lab](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/using-grunt-with-pattern-lab/)

## The holy grail
- Holy Grail is when the pattern library and production environment are perfectly in sync. Make a change to a pattern library, and anywhere the pattern is included in production will be updated.
- [Rizzo](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/) by Lonely Planet has accomplished this.

### Strategies for achieving the holy grail
- [Chasing the holy grail](https://medium.com/@marcelosomers/chasing-the-holy-grail-bbc0b7cce365#.vy45rkm7m)

## Make it cross-disciplinary
- Not just a developer tool. Not just a designer tool. Every discipline invested in the success of the website should be contributing to the pattern library.
- Carousel component example - amazingly complex component requiring input from business owners, editorial staff, content strategists, art directors, UX designers, front-end people, backend people

## Make it approachable
- No shocker here, but good design leads to more usage.
- Avoid exposing tons of code right out of the gate as it might discourage other disciplines from looking at it ("Oh this must not be for me")

## Make it visible
- Make it public.
- Recruitment, recruitment, recruitment.

### Make it agnostic
- The more agnostic pattern names are, the more versatile and reusable they become.
- Nicole Sullivan [media object](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)

### Make it contextual
- Demonstrate context. Where are
- Pattern Lab lineage

### Make it last
- Publish updates (Material Design example)
- Regular E-mail newsletters, blog updates, etc, whenever things change
- Monitor progress - Lonely Planet performance

## Go forth and be atomic
