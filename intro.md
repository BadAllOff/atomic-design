Why, hello there. 

## What
_Atomic Design_ is a book by yours truly. Here’s what I’m going to cover in the book:

- Explain why thinking of our interfaces as systems rather than a collection of pages is increasingly important.
- Introduce atomic design as a methodology for crafting an effective interface design system
- Describe tools and techniques to create interface design systems
- Cover how to make pattern-based design and development a cornerstone of your process, and how to effectively creating and maintain

## Why
The Web is 25 years old

## How
The traditional way to write a book involves retreating to an ivory tower, emerging a year or so later, and declaring “Behold! I have written a book for you to consume.” 

I don’t want to do that. 

After spending the last year directly benefitting from [designing in the open](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/) and also working on a few painful closed projects, I realize that this project would benefit from being written in the open.

## Where
This book will begin its life as a living, breathing entity. Eventually it will become an e-book available in the appropriate formats.

The end goal for this project is for _Atomic Design_ to exist as a physical book in 2015.
