    <h1><em>Chapter 2</em> Atomic Design Methodology</h1>
    <div class="note">
	<p>Greetings, reader! The following text is a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-design-book/">work in progress</a> so be warned you will encounter incomplete thoughts, grammar errors, and more. If you see something worth fixing, please <a href="https://github.com/bradfrost/atomic-design">submit an issue on Github</a>. Thanks and happy reading!</p>

    <p>My search for a methodology to craft interface design systems led me to look for inspiration in other fields and industries. Given this amazingly complex world we’ve created, it seems only natural that other disciplines would have tackled similar problems we could learn from and appropriate. As it turns out, loads of other fields <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=7e093c5cf4&amp;id=ead8a72012&amp;e=ecb25a3f93">such as industrial design and architecture</a> have developed smart modular systems for manufacturing immensely complex objects like airplanes, ships, and skyscrapers. </p>

<p>But my original explorations kept creeping back to the natural world, which ultimately triggered memories of sitting in a rickety desk in my high school’s chemistry lab. </p>

<p>My high school chemistry class was taught by a no-nonsense Vietnam vet with an extraordinarily impressive mustache. Mr. Rae’s class had a reputation for being one of the hardest classes in school, largely in part of an assignment that required students to balance hundreds and hundreds of chemical equations in a massive worksheet. </p>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you’ll need a bit of a refresher to recall what a chemical equation looks like, so here you go:</p>

</figure>

<p>Chemical equations describe how atomic elements, the basic building blocks of all matter, combine together to form molecules. In the above example, we see how hydrogen and oxygen combine together to form water molecules. </p>

<p>Apparently Mr. Rae’s strategy of having students balance page after page of chemical equations worked, because I kept coming back to it for inspiration for how to approach interface design all these years later.</p>

<p>In the natural world, atoms combine together to form molecules, which combine further to create more complex molecules. These molecules continue to combine together to form relatively complex organisms </p>

<p>Atoms: basic building blocks of matter. They have distinct properties and can’t be broken down further without losing their meaning.</p>

<p>As it turns out, we have </p>

<p>Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create deliberate interface design systems. <strong>The five stages of atomic design are are atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages</strong>.</p>

<p>If atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, then what are the atoms of our interfaces? Translated to interfaces, atoms are basic tags, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.</p>

<p>Atoms are abstract and aren’t often terribly useful on their own, but they provide a useful reference and allow you to see all your global styles laid out at a glance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Atoms definition: basic tags and other design elements that can’t be broken down any further.</li>
  <li>Why atoms: see all interface styles abstracted at a glance, etc</li>
  <li>too abstract to be useful, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="molecules">Molecules</h2>
<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/atomic-design-molecules.png" alt="molecules" />
	<figcaption>
	    molecules
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, which take on new properties as a result.</p>

<p>In interfaces, molecules are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.</p>

<p>Building up from atoms to molecules encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality, and encourages creating reusable interface patterns.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Molecules definition: a group of atoms joined together to form a relatively simple module. For example, a label, input, and button atom joining together to form a search form molecule.</li>
  <li>Why Molecules: single responsibility principle, assemble rather than deconstruct, testing, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="organisms">Organisms</h2>
<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/atomic-design-organisms.png" alt="organisms" />
	<figcaption>
	    organisms
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Organisms are groups of molecules (and possibly atoms) joined together to form distinct section of an interface.</p>

<p>Organisms can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo, navigation, and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the same product info molecule repeated over and over.</p>

<p>Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating standalone, portable, reusable components.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organisms definition: groups of molecules (and possibly atoms) joined together to form distinct section of an interface.</li>
  <li>Why Organisms: reusable interface components, more concrete than atoms and molecules, encourages portability, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/atomic-design-templates.png" alt="templates" />
	<figcaption>
	    templates
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With templates, we break our biochemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to clients and final output. Templates are composed mostly of organisms combined together to form page-level objects.</p>

<p>Templates provide context for these relatively abstract molecules and organisms, which is helpful for designers and clients alike.</p>

<p>Templates mostly focus on content structure (such as character length, image size, etc) rather than the actual content.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Breaking the chemistry analogy to get into the deliverables language</li>
  <li>Templates definition: page-level documents that provide context for these relatively abstract molecules and organisms, and  focus on content structure</li>
  <li>Why Templates: focus on content structure, can begin as wireframes and evolve over time, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/atomic-design-pages.png" alt="pages" />
	<figcaption>
	    pages
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Pages are specific instances of templates and swap out placeholder content with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.</p>

<p>Pages are essential for testing the effectiveness of the design system. This final form allows us to loop back to modify our molecules, organisms, and templates to better address the real context of the design.</p>

<p>Pages also provide a place to test variations in templates, such as testing an article containing a 40-character-length headline and other article with a 340-character-length headline. What does it look like when a user has one item in their shopping cart versus 10 items with a discount code applied? These specific page instances test the resiliency of the system, influencing how the underlying molecules, organisms, and templates are constructed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Page definition: specific instances of a template. Replaces content structure with real representative content</li>
  <li>Why pages: Tests the resiliency of the system, test variations in content structure, extremely concrete, it’s what the client naturally ends up focusing on since it’s what</li>
  <li>Page considerations: Clients/colleagues can get distracted by representative content (“I don’t like how I look in that photo”) vs commenting on effectiveness of the design.
