    <blockquote>
To boldly go beyond “pages.” That’s the universe of modern design, and there’s no better guide to exploring it than Brad Frost. In Atomic Design, he replaces our outdated, closed workflows with exciting new collaborative ones, and teaches us to design not just pages but systems. Recommended for all web and interaction designers.
<cite>Jeffrey Zeldman, author of <em>Designing With Web Standards</em></cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"This book is itself an excellent example of Atomic Design. Brad takes on a big intimidating topic—design systems the web—and breaks it down into its constituent parts, making it easy to understand and implement."
<cite>Jeremy Keith, author <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em></cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Brad describes not only the atomic design methodology, but also the process involved in making it successful. With the knowledge and experience of working on big and small websites, he'll equip you with the skills needed to build a comprehensive design system that works for your organisation, that is easy to update, and that lives on for months and years to come.
<cite>Anna Debenham, author of <em>Front-end Style Guides</em></cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Brad is suggesting that we'd be better web designers if we thought of what we're building as a system. A hierarchical system that fits together to form larger parts. Because, spoiler alert, it is and we would be.
<cite>Chris Coyier, CSS Tricks</cite>
