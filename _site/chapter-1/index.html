    <p>A long, long time ago, there were these things called <em>books</em>. Remember them? These contraptions were heavy and bulky and made of dead trees. Inside these books were things called <em>pages</em>. You turned them, and they cut your fingers.</p>

<p>Awful things. I’m so glad these book things and their razor-sharp pages aren’t around anymore.</p>

<p>Oh wait.</p>

<h2 id="our-paginated-past">Our Paginated Past</h2>
<p>The <em>page</em> has been with us for a long time now. A few millennia, actually. The first books were thick slabs of clay created about 2,000 years ago, which quickly replaced scrolls as the preferred way to consume the written word. <em>(note: footnote referring back to The Shallows)</em>. And while reading technology has come a long way – from parchment to paperback to pixels – the concept of the page holds strong to this day. </p>

<p>The page metaphor has been baked into the lexicon of the Web since the very beginning. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web so that he, his colleagues at CERN, and other academics could easily share and link together their web of <em>documents</em>. This document-based, academic genesis of the Web is why the concept of the <em>page</em> is so deeply ingrained in the vocabulary of the internet.</p>

<p>So what? </p>

<p>As we’ll discuss throughout this book, the way things are named very much impact how they’re perceived and utilized. Thinking of the Web as <em>pages</em> has real ramifications on how people interact with web experiences, and influences how we as an industry go about creating Web interfaces.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the page metaphor provided users with a familiar language for which to navigate this brave new World Wide Web. Concepts like bookmarking, pagination etc.</p>

<p><em>[note: image of Chrome “This Webpage is not available” ]</em></p>

<p>The page metaphor has had a profound influence on how web experiences are created.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Web, companies looking to get online simply translated their printed materials onto their websites. Viewing a website as simply a digital representation of the printed page was easy for people to wrap their hands around. Of course these brochure websites reflected a very one-dimensional perspective of what the Web could offer, but hey, it was a start.</p>

<p>“Brad, how long will the home <em>page</em> take to build?” Well, that sort of depends on what’s on it, right? Maybe the homepage consists of a tagline and a background image, which means it’ll be done by lunch. Or maybe it’s chock full of carousels, sophisticated forms, third-party integrations.</p>

<p>The page metaphor served its purpose helping users familiarize themselves with this new medium, and provided . But in order to create thoughtful Web experiences  the time to move away from the page metaphor.</p>
