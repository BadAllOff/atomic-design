    <p>A long, long time ago, there were these things called <em>books</em>. Remember them? These contraptions were heavy and bulky and made from the pulp of dead trees. Inside these books were things called <em>pages</em>. You turned them, and they cut your fingers.</p>

<p>Awful things. I’m so glad these book things with their razor-sharp pages aren’t around anymore.</p>

<p>Oh wait.</p>

<h2 id="our-paginated-past">Our paginated past</h2>
<p>The <em>page</em> has been with us for a long time now. A few millennia, actually. The first books were thick slabs of clay created about 2,000 years ago, which quickly replaced scrolls as the preferred way to consume the written word. <em>(note: footnote referring back to The Shallows)</em>. And while reading technology has come a long way – from parchment to paperback to pixels – the concept of the page holds strong to this day. </p>

<p>The page metaphor has been baked into the lexicon of the Web since the very beginning. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web so that he, his colleagues at CERN, and other academics could easily share and link together their world of <em>documents</em>. This document-based, academic genesis of the Web is why the concept of the <em>page</em> is so deeply ingrained in the vocabulary of the internet.</p>

<p>So what? </p>

<p>As we’ll discuss throughout this book, the way things are named very much impact how they’re perceived and utilized. Thinking of the Web as <em>pages</em> has real ramifications on how people interact with web experiences, and influences how we as an industry go about creating Web interfaces.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the page metaphor provided users with a familiar language for which to navigate this brave new World Wide Web. Concepts like bookmarking, pagination, etc. helped new Web users explore and eventually master an entirely new medium using conventions they were already comfortable with.</p>

</figure>

<p>The page was–and continues to be–a very visible and helpful metaphor for the end users of the Web. It also has a profound influence on how Web experiences are created.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Web, companies looking to get online simply translated their printed materials onto their websites. But even though these brochure websites offered a very one-dimensional perspective of what the Web could offer, viewing websites as digital representations of the printed page was easy for creators to wrap their heads around. </p>

<p>But we’re now 25 years into this new medium, and this once-necessary figure of speech has overstayed its welcome. Unfortunately, the page metaphor continues to run deep with respects to how we scope and execute our Web projects. Here are just a few examples I hear on a regular basis:</p>

<p>“We’re a startup looking to launch a 5-<em>page</em> website this October…”</p>

<p>“Brad, how long will the home <em>page</em> take to build?”</p>

<p>“How are we ever going to redesign this university website that contains over 30,000 <em>pages</em>?!”</p>

<p>All of the above statements make the fundamental mistake of assuming a <em>page</em> is a uniform, isolated, quantifiable thing. The reality is that the Web is a fluid, bi-directional, interdependent medium, and as soon as we come to terms with that fact the notion of the <em>page</em> quickly erodes as a useful means to scope and create Web experiences.</p>

<p>How long will a homepage take to build? Well, that sort of depends on what’s on it, right? Maybe the homepage simply consists of a  tagline and a background image, which means it could be done by lunch. Or maybe it’s chock full of carousels, dynamic forms, and third-party integrations. In that case, maybe the homepage will take several months to complete. </p>

<p>As for the 30,000-page university website, it might be tempting to declare “Thousands of pages!? Wow, that sounds challenging!” But in reality, those 30,000 pages may consist of three content types and two over-arching layouts.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a project’s level of effort is much better determined by the functionality and <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/scope-components-not-pages/">components</a> contained within those pages, rather than on the quantity of pages themselves.</p>

<p>The page metaphor served its purpose helping users familiarize themselves with the Web, and provided creators with a necessary transitional language for which to create for a brand new medium. But in order to create thoughtful interfaces meant to be served to a multitude of connected devices, the time has come for us to evolve beyond the page.</p>

<h2 id="tearing-up-the-page">Tearing up the page</h2>
<p>Thankfully, the Web community is hard at work establishing principles and practices to help us effectively talk about and create for the Web. And there’s one concept the keeps popping up in every conversation about how to create successful Web experiences: <strong>modularity</strong>. </p>

<p>The concept of modularity predates the Web by a long shot. The Industrial Revolution brought about interchangeable parts
and Henry Ford’s assembly line, which forever transformed the automobile-manufacturing process. Early cars and components were individually crafted, which led to many safety and maintainability nightmares. Ford broke the automobile down into its component parts, and modularized the assembly process. The results spoke for themselves: more uniform, reliable, safer cars rolled out of the factory, and in record time to boot.   </p>

<p>As the machine age transitioned into the computer age, the computer science field began practicing object-oriented programming and establishing important modular concepts like <em>separation of concerns</em> and the <em>single responsibility principle</em>. It is from this world that the World Wide Web was born, so it’s no surprise that <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#Modular">modular design</a> quickly became a design principle for the architecture of the Web. </p>

<p>Slowly but surely these concepts found their way into web designers’ workflows. In the early 2000’s we saw the introduction of libraries like <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a> and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>, which provided developers with a toolkit of widgets and patterns to better create interactive interfaces.</p>

<p>If modularity has been around for such a long time, why are we talking about it now?</p>

<p>The short answer is that modularity matters now more than ever. Right now, our entire industry is drowning in a sea of devices, viewport sizes, and online environments. And things aren’t slowing down anytime soon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disruption will only accelerate. The quantity and diversity of connected devices—many of which we haven’t imagined yet—will explode, as will the quantity and diversity of the people around the world who use them. Our existing standards, workflows, and infrastructure won’t hold up. Today’s onslaught of devices is already pushing them to the breaking point. They can’t withstand what’s ahead. <cite><a href="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/">The Future-Friendly manifesto</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an effort to maintain our sanity, we need to . How can we create effective Web experiences? </p>

<p>Modularity is rearing its head across all aspects of the Web creation process, affecting strategy, process, content, design, and development.</p>
