    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>Why, hello there. Thanks for stumbling onto <em>Atomic Design</em>, a book about crafting effective interface design systems. </p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p><em>Atomic Design</em> is a book by yours truly. Here’s what I’m going to cover in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explain why thinking of our interfaces as systems rather than a collection of pages is increasingly important.</li>
  <li>Introduce atomic design as a methodology for crafting an effective interface design system</li>
  <li>Describe tools and techniques to create interface design systems</li>
  <li>Cover how to make pattern-based design and development an integral aspect of your process, and how to effectively create and maintain your own pattern library.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>The Web is 25 years old</p>

<p>The Web community has spent the last </p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>The traditional way to write a book involves retreating to an ivory tower, emerging a year or so later, and declaring “Behold! I have written a book for you to consume.” </p>

<p>I’m not doing that. </p>

<p>After spending the last year directly benefitting from <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/">designing in the open</a> and also working on a few painful closed projects, I realize that this project would benefit from being written in the open.</p>

<p><strong>The book is available for purchase now</strong>. While it’s a bit unusual to sell a book that’s incomplete, the idea is to get the content out there in a timely manner and to help fund the project. </p>

<p>By purchasing the book up front, here’s what you get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>final e-book</strong> in all available formats</li>
  <li>A <strong>heavy discount on the print edition</strong> of the book</li>
  <li>A <strong>discount on any extras</strong>, which may include: videos, tutorials, sample code, workshops</li>
  <li><strong>My eternal gratitude</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>
<p>This book is a living, breathing entity. The book’s progress will be shared openly and the latest, greatest state will be available <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">online</a>. You can keep track of updates on the <a href="https://github.com/bradfrost/atomic-design/">Github repository</a>. I’ll be posting updates on my <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog">blog</a> and will be sharing my book-writing adventures and frustrations as much as time allows.</p>

<p>When the manuscript is complete, it will become an e-book available in the most popular e-book formats. </p>

<p>The end goal for this project is for <em>Atomic Design</em> to exist as a physical book in 2015. While I mostly operate in the digital world, the prospect of creating a physical book is tremendously exciting.	</p>

<h2 id="who">Who</h2>
<p>This book is written, edited, and published by me. It may stay that way. It may not. </p>

<p>I may bring on an editor to help bring this project to life, but that’s to be determined. I’m planning to bring on someone who can help review any technical aspects of the book.</p>

<p>I currently don’t plan to go through a book publisher, but would be open to the idea if the right opportunity presented itself.</p>
