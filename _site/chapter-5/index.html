    <p>And they made a design system, delivered a pattern library, and lived happily ever after. Right? </p>

<p>Not quite.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/trash-can.jpg" alt="" />

<p>There’s a very real risk that a pattern library will end up in the trashcan right alongside all the PSDs, PDFs and other artifacts of the design process. Despite everyone’s best intentions, all that time and effort that went into into making a thoughtful design system and pattern library can go straight down the drain.</p>

<p>How can that be?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap &amp; backlog, serving an ecosystem. <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608">Nathan Curtis</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>An artifact is something you’d find in an archaeological dig or a museum, whereas a system is a living, breathing entity</strong>. A pattern library can provide helpful documentation and serve as a helpful resource, but the simple existence of a pattern library doesn’t guarantee longterm success for the underlying design system. A design system needs ongoing maintenance, support, and tender loving care for it to truly thrive. </p>

<h2 id="changing-minds-once-again">Changing minds, once again</h2>
<p>We’ve already discussed the importance of resetting everyone’s expectations in order to establish a more collaborative, pattern-driven workflow. In order to save our design systems from the trash can, we must once again fundamentally rewire people’s brains in order to craft lasting design systems.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-it-were-making-again">What is it we’re making again?</h3>
<p>We <em>think</em> we merely design and build websites and apps. And that’s true for the most part. After all, that’s what our clients pay us to do, and the products we create are the vehicles that generate money and success for an organization. So it seems natural to focus on the final implementations rather than the underlying system. With this mentality, the live products remain the primary focus of everyone’s attention, while any pattern library exists as an offshoot that simply provides helpful documentation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/workflow-website-first.png" alt="" />
	<figcaption>
	    
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The problem with this mentality is that you can almost see that pattern library snapping off and sliding off into the abyss.  <strong>Once the pattern library ceases to reflect the current state of the products it serves, it becomes obsolete</strong>. And when the pattern library managing the design system is no longer accurate, the website maintenance process devolves into a smattering of hotfixes and ad hoc changes, ruining all the thoughtfulness that went into creating the original design system.</p>

<p>In order to set our design systems up for longterm success, we must fundamentally shift our mentality around just what exactly it is we’re creating. Rather than thinking of the final product as our sole responsibility, we must recognize that the design system is what underpins our final products <em>and</em> pattern libraries.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/workflow-system-first.png" alt="" />
	<figcaption>
	    
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This “design system first” mentality inserts a bit of friction into the maintenance process, and that <strong>friction can be friendly</strong>. It forces us to step back and consider how any improvements, client requests, feature additions, and iterations impact the overall system rather than only a sliver of the whole ecosystem. </p>

<p>Say for instance you’re working on an e-commerce site, and you run a test to find a custom-styled dropdown menu on the product detail page isn’t performing as well as the browser’s default dropdown menu. One course of action is to simply remove the custom-styled dropdown from that particular page and call it a day. However, considering the entire design system rather than just the product detail page might cause you to take a step back and ask, “If this custom dropdown menu isn’t performing well here, perhaps it’s not performing well elsewhere?” After digging into the issue further, you find the best course of action is to globally modify the dropdown pattern in the design system to remove the custom styling. Now anywhere the dropdown pattern appears will reflect those changes and will likely see similar performance improvements.</p>

<p>That is just one example of how design system thinking can lead to broader, more considered changes. <strong>Broken behavior and opportunities to enhance the UI will often be realized at the <em>page</em> level, but those changes should often be acted on at the <em>system</em> level</strong>. Adding this bit of worthwhile friction into your workflow ensures improvements are shared across the entire design system, and that the system isn’t eroded by a series of one-off changes.</p>

<h3 id="done-and-done">Done and done</h3>
<p>Another expectation we must revisit is our definition of <em>done</em>. Creating things for print and other physical mediums involve making permanent, tangible objects. That sense of finality simply doesn’t exist in the digital world, which means change can happen with much less effort and friction than other mediums. <strong>Clients, colleagues, and stakeholders should embrace the pliable nature of the digital world to create living design systems that adapt to the ever-shifting nature of the medium, user needs, and the needs of the business</strong>. </p>

<p>This shift in thinking fundamentally impacts the scope of our work. Folks working in the client services business are often used to delivering a project in a tidy package then riding off into the sunset. Internal teams don’t fair much better, since they tend to float from one initiative to the next. Whether you’re part of an internal team or are an external gun for hire, I’m guessing you’ve experienced the shortcomings of project-based work. We tend to talk about a future that never comes, and instead we set it, forget it, then move onto the next shiny project.</p>

<p>If we’re committed to creating genuinely useful work that truly meets the needs of our clients and organizations, we must fundamentally redefine the scope of our work. As Nathan Curtis says, a design system shouldn’t be a <em>project</em> with a finite scope, but rather a <em>product</em> meant to grow and evolve over time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focusing on style guide delivery as the climax is the wrong story to tell. A system isn’t a project with an end, it’s the origin story of a living and evolving product that’ll serve other products. <cite><a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/a-design-system-isn-t-a-project-it-s-a-product-serving-products-74dcfffef935#.4umtnfxsx">Nathan Curtis</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The web is never done, and the creation of a design system is merely the first step in a long (and hopefully fruitful!) journey. A design system should be a longterm commitment with the ambitious goal of revolutionizing how your organization creates digital work. Exciting, eh?! So how do we make sure that happens?</p>

<h2 id="creating-maintainable-design-systems">Creating Maintainable Design Systems</h2>
<p>As you embark on this pattern-paved journey, let’s talk about things you can do to craft a design system that sets your organization up for longterm success. How do you create a design system that takes root and becomes an essential part of your organization’s workflow? What pitfalls do you need to be on the lookout for? How do you ensure the design system yields big results? To set your design system up for longterm success, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make it official.</li>
  <li>Make it adaptable.</li>
  <li>Make it maintainable.</li>
  <li>Make it cross-disciplinary.</li>
  <li>Make it approachable.</li>
  <li>Make it public.</li>
  <li>Make it bigger.</li>
  <li>Make it agnostic.</li>
  <li>Make it contextual.</li>
  <li>Make it last.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s dive into each one of these points in a bit more detail.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-official">Make it official</h2>
<p>Your initial style guide may begin its life as a side project, result of a weekend hackathon, or as the brainchild of one or two ambitious team members. As we discussed in the last chapter, your client or boss doesn’t even have to know that you’re creating a thoughtful design system and accompanying pattern library. Remember: ask forgiveness, not permission!</p>

<p>Organic beginnings are all well and good, but in order to establish a truly impactful design system that creates longterm success for your organization, <strong>the design system needs to evolve into an officially-sanctioned endeavor</strong>. That means thinking of it as a true product rather than a simple side project, and consequently allocating real time, budget, and people to it.</p>

<p>Convincing stakeholders to commit a large chunk of money, time, and resources upfront for a design system can be extremely challenging. So what are we to do? Here’s my advice:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a thing.</li>
  <li>Show that it’s useful.</li>
  <li>Make it official.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s break down these steps a bit further.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-make-a-thing">Step 1: make a thing</h3>
<p>You have to start somewhere, and having something started is better than nothing at all. Pick a project that would be a great pilot for establishing your design system, follow a process similar to the one discussed in <a href="/chapter-4/">chapter 4</a>, think about the atomic design mental model detailed in <a href="/chapter-2/">chapter 2</a>, and you’ll end up with a solid foundation for a thoughtful design system and pattern library that helps your team work more effectively. </p>

<p>Take the time to package your UI patterns in a pattern library and get it ready to shop around. I’ve talked to several ambitious team members who have built the basic gist of their pattern library over the course of a weekend. This effort makes all the difference in the world since it gives something tangible for stakeholders to react to. Again: <em>show, don’t tell</em>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-show-that-its-useful">Step 2: show that it’s useful</h3>
<p>With a nascent-yet-tangible design system in place, you can have a more meaningful conversation with the people who control money, scheduling, and resources. You can discuss exactly how the design system helped save time and money (see <em><a href="/chapter-4/#pitching-patterns">Pitching Patterns</a></em> in the last chapter), then paint a picture for how those benefits would scale even further if the organization invested in an official, full-fledged design system. </p>

<p>Get team members from different disciplines to back you up and discuss the initial success of the system, and also pull in others who are sympathetic to the cause that would stand to benefit from an expanded design system. </p>

<h3 id="step-3-make-it-official">Step 3: make it official</h3>
<p>You’ve proven the value of your initial design system and presented a roadmap for how to make it even better. With any luck your organization will commit to making the design system an Official Thing. </p>

<p>With approval from the highest levels, you’re now able to put a plan into action that involves: allocating and/or hiring people to work on the design system, developing a plan to make the design system more comprehensive, establishing a clear governance strategy, and laying out a product roadmap for the design system.</p>

<p>Now it’s worth pointing out that (as with many things in life) things may not shake out the way you hoped. Despite demonstrating real value and presenting a concrete plan of action, higher ups still might shoot your initiative down. <strong>Don’t be discouraged</strong>. You may have lost the battle, but you certainly haven’t lost the war. Your team should continue to grow and extend the design system (in whatever capacity you can) until its value becomes undeniable. As more people benefit from the system, you’ll end up with a grassroots support system that can help push the endeavor through.</p>

<h3 id="establishing-a-design-system-team">Establishing a design system team</h3>
<p>With the design system initiative approved, it’s now time to put the right people and processes in place to ensure the system flourishes for your organization.</p>

<h4 id="design-system-makers-and-users">Design system makers and users</h4>
<p>First things first. It’s important to recognize that <strong>there will inevitably be people at the organization that help <em>make and maintain</em> the design system, and there will be other people who will be <em>users</em> of the design system</strong>. These two groups may not be mutually exclusive, but establishing the roles of makers and users is important.</p>

<p>When I talk about establishing a more collaborative process like the one I detailed in the last chapter, I inevitably hear people who work at large organizations say, “but Brad, we have hundreds (or even thousands) of developers working on our products, so getting all those people to collaborate and contribute like that would be far too difficult.”</p>

<p>They’re likely right. It would be ideal if the entire organization adopted more nimble, collaborative processes, but the daunting logistics around such an effort makes it improbable. But here’s the thing. Not <em>everyone</em> in the organization needs to directly contribute to the design system, but someone (or more likely, some people) must take ownership of it.</p>

<p><strong>The design system <em>makers</em> are the ones who architect, create, and maintain the system</strong>, and they need to work closely together to ensure that the system is smart, flexible, scalable, and addresses the needs of the users and business. <strong>The design system <em>users</em> are the teams across the organization who will take the system and employ its interface patterns to specific applications</strong>. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/fpo.png" alt="Design system makers and users" />
	<figcaption>
	    Design system makers and users
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>The design system <em>makers</em> and design system <em>users</em> need to maintain a close working relationship</strong> to ensure the patterns defined within the system serve the needs of the applications and all documentation is clear. <strong>Makers provide a birds-eye perspective of the entire ecosystem the design system serves, while users provide an on-the-ground perspective focused on specific applications of the system</strong>. Both perspectives are critical to the success of the design system, which is why it’s so important for makers and users to have a healthy relationship that involves frequent communication and collaboration. </p>

<h4 id="who-are-the-design-system-makers">Who are the design system makers?</h4>
<p>Who updates the design system? Who approves changes? Who interfaces with the users of the design system to make sure it’s addressing their needs? Who gets to decide which patterns stay, go, or need tweaked? </p>

<p>The answers to these questions <strong>will very much depend on the size and setup of your organization</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Large organizations</strong> like Salesforce maintain an official <em>design systems team</em>, which currently includes about a dozen full-time employees last I heard. That dedicated team is responsible for governing the design system and making sure it’s meeting the needs of the myriad internal product teams, as well as external developers that build things on the company’s platform. When a design system is serving literally thousands of  users, it’s a smart idea to dedicate at least a few full-time employees to manage and grow the system.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/fpo.png" alt="Large organization diagram" />
	<figcaption>
	    Large organization diagram
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Smaller organizations</strong> most likely don’t have the luxury of building an entire team to service a design system. Team members in smaller organizations have to wear many (hopefully stylish!) hats out of necessity, so governing the design system will likely become another responsibility. This may sound like an added burden (“oh great, yet another thing I’m responsible for that doesn’t involve a pay raise!”), but this particular hat should be a joy to wear as it improves the efficiency and quality of all other work. Hooray for design systems! </p>

<p>Typically, design system makers at smaller organizations will be senior-level staff who have the experience to make thoughtful decisions and authority to enforce the design system.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/fpo.png" alt="Small organization diagram" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And then there are <strong>external agencies, contractors, and consultants</strong>. What is the role of an external party when it comes to longterm maintenance of a client’s design system? On one hand, external parties are at a bit of a disadvantage since they don’t actually work for their client’s organization. A successful design system needs to become a part of an organization’s DNA, and since external parties exist outside the company’s walls, their influence is intrinsically limited.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, <strong>external parties can often provide a sense of perspective</strong> that’s hard to see while working inside a company. This is where outsiders can really shine. In my work as a consultant, I work with organizations to establish longterm design system maintenance strategies and help get the right people and processes in place. While the longterm success of the system will ultimately be up to the organization themselves, external parties can teach them to fish and provide important strategic guidance, feedback, and perspective. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/fpo.png" alt="Third-party diagram" />
	<figcaption>
	    Third-party diagram

</figure>

<h4 id="who-are-the-design-system-users">Who are the design system users?</h4>
<p>Who are the people responsible for using the design system to build new features and applications? Who are the people that communicate with the system makers to report issues and request features?</p>

<p>Once again, the answers to these questions will largely depend on your organization’s size and structure.</p>

<p><strong>Design system users may be the same team creating the design system, separate development teams within your organization, junior-level designers and developers, partner agencies, external development shops, and/or other third-party teams</strong>. </p>

<p>Users’ proximity to and involvement in the creation of the design system will undoubtedly vary. You may work on a singular product at a scrappy startup, so your small team very well may be the ones simultaneously creating and using the design system.  Or you may work at a large multi-national corporation with development teams and third-party partners scattered all across the globe. If this is the case, design system makers and users may seldom (or ever) meet, which means that helpful documentation and a sharp birds-eye perspective becomes that much more important. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/fpo.png" alt="Spectrum of design system users" />

</figure>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of establishing a thoughtful design system is that it allows organizations to scale best practices. If all those best practices — responsiveness, accessibility, performance, UX, ergonomics, and so on — are baked into the system, users can simply plug in patterns and reap the rewards. This means design system users don’t have to be senior-level designers or developers to produce good work; the design system serves as quality control vehicle that helps users apply best practices regardless of each individual’s skill level.</p>

<h3 id="design-system-team-makeup">Design system team makeup</h3>
<p><strong>A cross-disciplinary team should be established in order to properly manage, maintain, and extend the system</strong>. All disciplines at an organization — UX designers, visual designers, content strategists, frontend developers, backend developers, product managers, project managers, executives, and other stakeholders — have unique perspectives that can undoubtedly inform and shape the work. Incorporating these perspectives into the design system is important, but doesn’t necessarily require every discipline to constantly be involved in developing the design system.</p>

<p>There will inevitably be disciplines that actively do the work, while other disciplines may take on more of an advisory role. <strong>The disciplines responsible for designing and building the user interface — UX designers, visual designers, frontend developers — will likely serve as the hands that do the work and make updates to the design system</strong>. They should work collaboratively (as detailed in the last chapter) and coordinate with the other disciplines to ensure that the system reflects the values and considerations of the entire business.</p>

<p><strong>Other disciplines may not be the ones actively doing the work, but must be consulted to make sure their perspectives are properly reflected in the system</strong>. Backend engineers need to make the team aware of any architectural decisions that would affect the frontend UI, executives need to make the team aware of important initiatives that will affect the role and utility of the system, and of course design system users need to coordinate with the makers to ensure the system is serving the needs of individual applications. </p>

<h2 id="make-it-adaptable">Make it adaptable</h2>
<p>Change is the only constant, as they say. <strong>The <em>living</em> part of a living design system means that it needs to roll with the punches, adapt to feedback, be iterated upon, and evolve alongside the products it serves</strong>.  </p>

<p>A misconception about design systems is that once they’re established, they become an omnipotent and unchangeable source of truth. Thinking in such a rigid way is a surefire way to stir up a mutiny amongst the design system’s users. If users are pigeon-holed into using patterns that don’t solve their problems, they’ll go rogue and find something that will solve their needs. </p>

<p><strong>Creating a clear governance plan is essential for making sure your design system can adapt and thrive even as time goes by</strong>.  A solid governance strategy starts by answering some important questions about handling change. Consider the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens when an existing pattern doesn’t quite work for a specific application? Does the pattern get modified? Do you recommend using a different pattern? Does a new pattern need created?</li>
  <li>How are new pattern requests handled?</li>
  <li>How do old patterns get retired? </li>
  <li>What happens when bugs are found?</li>
  <li>Who approves changes to the design system?</li>
  <li>Who is responsible for keeping documentation up to date?</li>
  <li>Who actually makes changes to the system’s UI patterns? </li>
  <li>How are design system changes deployed to live applications?</li>
  <li>How will people find out about changes?</li>
</ul>

<p>This list isn’t comprehensive, but your team should have answers and processes in place to address changes to the design system. </p>

<p>As mentioned a few times already, frequent communication and collaboration between design system makers and users is key for successfully governing your design system. <strong>Make it as easy as possible to users and makers to communicate</strong>. Set up a design system Slack channel, establish regular office hours, make sure your bug ticket software helps facilitate conversation, and keep the doors open for ad hoc chats and calls. If users are stuck on something, they should know exactly where and who to turn to for help.</p>

<p>In addition to informal day-to-day conversation between makers and users, <strong>schedule regular “state of the union” meetings to review the design system</strong> with makers, users, and other key stakeholders. Discuss what’s working, be honest with what needs improved, and review priorities and the roadmap to make sure the   system is serving the needs of the business. These regular checkups are especially helpful for keeping stakeholders up to speed since they often aren’t involved in the day to day of the design system.</p>

<h3 id="making-changes-to-patterns">Making changes to patterns</h3>
<p>One thing that’s critical to the longterm success of your design system is to make sure the UI patterns are up to date and are properly serving the products. </p>

<h4 id="changing-patterns">Changing patterns</h4>

<h4 id="adding-patterns">Adding patterns</h4>

<h4 id="removing-patterns">Removing patterns</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have a plan for deprecating patterns that are no longer serving the organization.  https://github.com/salesforce-ux/sass-deprecate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="communicating-change">Communicating change</h3>
<p>You can create the best style guide in world, use the most appropriate technology, have an amazing team in place, and have excited users, but if you don’t communicate updates and changes to the design system the entire effort will suffer.</p>

<p>Makers, users, and other stakeholders need to be well aware of all the latest changes to and thinking around the design system. </p>

<p>Communication is especially important in the early days of the initiative. Frequent communication helps keep the design system in the front of everyone’s mind so it takes root and becomes an integral part of your organization’s workflow. <strong>As time goes on, frequent communication helps the system increase in value like that fine bottle of wine</strong>. Communication can include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Change logs (“Here’s what’s changed in the pattern library this month”)</li>
  <li>Roadmaps (“Here’s what’s coming up over the next few months”)</li>
  <li>requests for feedback (“We’re considering deprecating our carousel pattern and would like to hear what you think.”),</li>
  <li>Surveys (“On a scale from 1-5, how useful is the pattern documentation?”)</li>
  <li>Success stories (“Team X launched this new feature using the design system; read more about how they did it.”)</li>
  <li>Resources (“Here’s a great article about documenting “)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design system changes, updates, and requests should be communicated wherever your team hangs out</strong>. That may include Slack, BaseCamp, Github, wikis, Yammer, email lists, company blogs, intranets, and any other internal tools your team uses to communicate and collaborate. </p>

<h2 id="make-it-maintainable">Make it maintainable</h2>
<p>Many pattern libraries fall into a state of disrepair because the effort required to update patterns and documentation is far too high. If a pattern library is difficult and time consuming to update, people will eventually stop updating it and the pattern library will begin its drift into oblivion. Making updates to UI patterns and documentation should be as frictionless as possible, so reducing this friction should become a high priority for the design system team. This involves careful consideration from both a technological and workflow standpoint.</p>

<h3 id="in-search-of-the-holy-grail">In search of the Holy Grail</h3>
<p><strong>The design system Holy Grail involves creating an environment where the pattern library and production environment are perfectly in sync</strong>. The idea is that you should be able to make a change to a UI pattern and see those changes automatically reflected in both the pattern library and anywhere the pattern is included in production. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/workflow-system-first-holy-grail.png" alt="The Holy Grail of design systems is one where one can make a change to a UI pattern and have it simultaneously update the pattern library and production environments." />
	<figcaption>
	    The Holy Grail of design systems is one where one can make a change to a UI pattern and have it simultaneously update the pattern library and production environments.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Holy Grail removes any duplication of effort and ensures the pattern library and the applications using the patterns remain synchronized. Sounds like a dream, right?</p>

<p>As it turns out, this dream can be a reality. Lonely Planet, the travel guide company, established a Holy Grail-style design system they call <a href="http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/">Rizzo</a>. They created an API for their UI patterns that feeds into both their production environment as well as their pattern library. The result is a centralized design system that ensures their live application and documentation remains perfectly in sync with one another.</p>

<p>Achieving the design system Holy Grail is no easy task, as it requires sophisticated technical architecture and smart people to set it all up. How you go about chasing the Holy Grail — or even if you can achieve it — is dependent on a whole load of factors, including your technical architecture and organizational makeup.</p>

<p>[TODO]</p>

<p>In my experience, I’ve found that sharing CSS and JS with the production environment is relatively easy, but sharing markup is tough. </p>

<p>As we discussed in Chapter 3, using HTML templating languages makes markup portable and dynamic. Templating language should match the production environment - The closer you can get to matching your pattern library and production templating .</p>

<p>Be careful to keep documentation accessible to non developers.  
- Look for opportunities to automate documentation

<p>How can you set up your applications and pattern library to achieve the Holy Grail? Developer Marcelo Somers outlined several methods for thoughtfully keeping your pattern library and production environments in sync. <a href="https://medium.com/@marcelosomers/chasing-the-holy-grail-bbc0b7cce365#.vy45rkm7m">Chasing the holy grail</a></p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why an organization may <em>not</em> be able to achieve the Holy Grail. Perhaps your organization has digital products on many different platforms using wildly different technologies. For example, the U.S. government’s design system — called the U.S. Web Digital Standards — is a collection of UI components and visual styles meant to help people making government websites make more consistent UIs. It would be amazing to see a Holy Grail-style system  However, due to the vastness and decentralized nature of the organization, it’s not really achievable.</p>

<p>Technology alone can’t achieve maintainable design systems; you must create a culture that communicates</p>

<p>[/TODO]</p>

<h2 id="make-it-cross-disciplinary">Make it cross-disciplinary</h2>
<p>Style guides often jump straight into code snippets and pattern usage for the benefit of the design system users. Of course a pattern library needs to be helpful for the people actually making use of the patterns, but <strong>treating a style guide solely a developer resource limits its potential</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>A style guide has the opportunity to serve as a watering hole for the entire organization</strong>, helping establish a common vocabulary for every discipline invested in the success of the company’s digital products. Establishing this common vocabulary can lead to more efficient work, better communication, and more collaboration between disciplines across the organization. That’s why the style guide should be an inviting place for everybody, not just design system users.</p>

<p>Take the carousel (please!). This component is amazingly complex from an organizational standpoint. A homepage carousel on an e-commerce website requires input from a myriad of disciplines across the organization. Business owners and editorial staff must choose products to be featured in the carousel. Copywriters must ensure the copy is effective and stays within the constraints of the design. Art directors must ensure the aesthetic design is pleasing and the product photography is legible across every screen size. UX designers need to ensure the functionality and controls are intuitive. Front-end people need to make sure the component is responsive, accessible, and performant. Backend developers need to make sure the component is properly wired up to the backend system. You get the idea. </p>

<p>A well-crafted style guide can help manage all these moving parts and ensure the many perspectives that influence each pattern are properly documented in the style guide. Make the pattern library accessible to every discipline, and think about how to make it easy and inviting for different disciplines to contribute to the documentation. </p>

<h2 id="make-it-approachable">Make it approachable</h2>
<p>This should come as a surprise to no one, but people tend to gravitate towards attractive things. A big part of making a style guide a cross-disciplinary resource is ensuring the container that houses your pattern library and other documentation is good-looking, inviting, and easy to navigate.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/styleguide-yelp.png" alt="Yelp's style guide has an attractive, friendly front page that explains what the resource is, who it's for, and how to use it." />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Taking the time to craft an attractive home for your style guide and documentation can lead to more usage, help build awareness,    help create organizational investment, and help get non-developers’ eyeballs on the style guide. All of this contributes to that important shared vocabulary that leads to better cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>

<p>But creating a great-looking, intuitive style guide experience doesn’t just happen, and this can be problematic when getting a style guide off the ground. If teams think that making a useful style guide involves making some Big, Official Thing with custom branding and a glossy website, they might be deterred from ever starting the initiative. So remember: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a thing. </li>
  <li>Show that it’s useful. </li>
  <li>Make it official. </li>
</ol>

<p>Creating a useful design system should be the team’s first priority. A happy home to contain it all might not happen right out of the gate, but should become a bigger priority once the design system becomes official. Making a good-looking style guide isn’t just design for design’s sake; <strong>it reflects an organization’s commitment to making and maintaining a thoughtful, deliberate design system</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-public">Make it public</h2>
<p>Another way to set your design system up for longterm success is to <strong>make your style guide publicly accessible</strong>.</p>

<p>But why? After all, isn’t a style guide merely an internal resource to help your organization work better together? What use is it to the outside world? And wouldn’t publishing your style guide give away all your trade secrets?</p>

<p><strong>Publishing your style guide for the world to see increases its visibility, increases accountability, and serves as an amazing recruitment tool</strong>.</p>

<p>Putting your style guide behind a login or firewall reduces visibility and adds an unnecessary burden for your team and partners, which limits the resource’s effectiveness and potential. And the fears about giving away your trade secrets are completely unfounded. These are UI patterns, not nuclear codes.</p>

<p>In addition to making important documentation easier to access, a public style guide <strong>helps create organizational accountability</strong>. Publishing your style guide demonstrates your organization’s commitment to the design system, which creates a helpful bit of pressure to keep it an up-to-date and useful resource. </p>

<p>Public-facing style guides are also <strong>hugely helpful for recruiting efforts</strong>. Designers, developers, and other disciplines are looking to work at organizations that embrace modern digital best practices, and (as we’ve discussed throughout this book) design systems are quickly becoming an industry-wide best practice. Publishing your style guide sends out a strong bat signal that can attract passionate, pattern-minded people. For instance, style guide expert Jina Bolton went to work at Salesforce after seeing the company’s style guide for their Salesforce1 product. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I saw Salesforce’s style guide I thought it was beautiful and it’s why I wanted to join this team. <cite><a href="http://styleguides.io/podcast/jina-bolton">Jina Bolton</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since joining Salesforce, she’s helped create the ultra-successful Lightning Design System and helps manage their growing design system team. Jina’s story is not an isolated one; almost every guest Anna Debenham and I interviewed on the <a href="http://styleguides.io/podcast">Styleguides Podcast</a> discussed how helpful their public-facing pattern library was for attracting talent. All that means that your a public style guide makes your organization <em>more</em> competitive, not less.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-bigger">Make it bigger</h2>
<p>A visible, cross-disciplinary, approachable pattern library is one that your team will come back to again and again. Use that to your advantage. Since the team’s eyeballs are already fixated on that one resource, there’s a big opportunity to extend it to include other helpful documentation like the voice and tone, brand, code, design principles and writing guidelines we discussed in <a href="/chapter-1/">chapter 1</a>. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/styleguide-harmony.png" alt="Intuit's Harmony design system includes a pattern library, design principles, voice and tone, marketing guidelines, and more. Housing this helpful documentation under one roof helps increase its visibility." />

</figure>

<p>Now, your organization may not need to create every flavor of style guide out there, but the point is that <strong>creating a centralized style guide hub builds more awareness of best practices, increasing the documentation’s effectiveness</strong>.</p>

<p>Another way to make the extend the functionality of the pattern library is to include native mobile app patterns alongside any web-based patterns. Once again, Intuit’s Harmony design system </p>

    <img src="../images/content/styleguide-harmony-2.png" alt="Intuit's Harmony pattern library includes tabs to switch between web, iOS, and Android for each pattern.

<h2 id="make-it-agnostic">Make it agnostic</h2>
<p>The way your UI patterns are named will undoubtedly shape how they are used. <strong>The more agnostic pattern names are, the more versatile and reusable they become</strong>.</p>

<p>Because we establish UI patterns in the context of a broader page, it can be tempting to name components based on where they live. But rather than naming your component “homepage carousel” (forgive my morbid obsession with carousels), you can simply call it “carousel” instead, which means you can now put carousels everywhere! (But for the love of all that is holy, please don’t.)</p>

<p>Another challenge for naming <em>display</em> patterns is that we tend to get distracted by the <em>content</em> patterns that live inside them. For instance, if working on an e-commerce site, you may be tempted to call a block containing a product image and title a “product card.” But naming things in this manner immediately limits what type of content can live inside it. By naming the pattern simply “card,” now you can put all sorts of content patterns inside it: products, promotions, store locations, etc.</p>

<p>Fair warning: <strong>naming things is really freaking hard</strong>. But there are strategies to help you create sound names for your patterns. Conducting an interface inventory (as detailed in <a href="/chapter-4/#show-dont-tell-the-power-of-interface-inventories">chapter 4</a>) helps remove patterns from the context of the page where they normally reside, meaning your team can create names that aren’t distracted by their context. And I’ve conducted naming exercises with teams where we’ve blurred out the content residing inside a pattern so everyone can focus on the pattern’s <em>structure</em> rather than the <em>content</em> that lives inside it.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/modal-blur.png" alt="When naming patterns, try blurring out their content so that your names reflect the patterns' structure rather than the content  that lives inside them." />
	<figcaption>

</figure>

<p>While naming things will always be a challenge, pattern names that are agnostic to context and content will be more portable, reusable, and versatile.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-contextual">Make it contextual</h2>
<p>Showcasing UI patterns in a pattern library is all well and good, but <strong>you need to demonstrate context in order for design system users to understand how and where to properly use them</strong>. Most pattern libraries show a demo of each UI pattern, but as we’ve discussed throughout this book, those patterns don’t live in a vacuum. Where exactly are these patterns utilized?</p>

<p>One way to demonstrate context might include showing screenshots or videos of a component in action. Material Design’s documentation does a fantastic job at this; each component is rich with photos, videos, and usage details to give their users a clear understanding of what these patterns look like in the context of an application and demonstrate how each pattern should be used.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/material-design-bottom-nav.png" alt="Material Design's component library doesn't just contain an example of each component; it thoroughly documents the component's usage with plenty of images and video to support it." />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another way to show context is to provide lineage information for each pattern. As we discussed in Chapter 3, tools like Pattern Lab automatically generate this information which lets you to see which patterns make up any given component, and also show where each component is employed. This provides a sort of pattern paper trail that helps immensely with QA efforts, as it highlights exactly which patterns and templates would need tested if changes were made to a particular pattern.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-lineage.png" alt="Tools like Pattern Lab allow teams to see which smaller components make up any given component, as well as where each pattern gets used." />

<h2 id="make-it-last">Make it last</h2>
<p>Making a design system is an incredibly and important endeavor. But without proper maintenance, the value of your design system will deprecate much like a car that’s just been driven off the dealer’s lot. Instead, your design system should be like a bottle of fine wine that increases value over time.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/fpo.png" alt="Used car and bottle of wine" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>

<p>So there you have it. In order to make a maintainable design system, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make it official</strong> by allocating real time, money, and resources to your design system.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it adaptable</strong> by counting on change and establishing a clear governance plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it maintainable</strong> by seeking the Holy Grail and making it easy to deploy and communicate changes to the design system.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it cross-disciplinary</strong> by making your pattern library become a watering hole the entire organization can gather around.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it approachable</strong> by making an attractive, easy-to-use pattern library with helpful documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it public</strong> to increase your design system’s visibility, increases accountability, and help with recruiting efforts.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it bigger</strong> by including brand, voice and tone, code, design principles, and writing guidelines. </li>
  <li><strong>Make it agnostic</strong> by naming patterns according to their structure rather than their context or content.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it contextual</strong> by demonstrating what patterns make up a particular pattern and showing where each pattern is utilized.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it last</strong> by creating a clear governance plan and communicating changes to the design system across the entire organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re tasked with making user interfaces work well and look great across a dizzying array of different devices, screen sizes, form factors, and environments. I hope that the concepts covered in this book give you solid ground to stand on as you bravely tackle this increasingly diverse digital landscape. By creating design systems, being thoughtful about how you construct user interfaces, establishing a collaborative &amp; pattern-driven workflow, and maintaining your design system, I hope you and your team can create great things together. Go forth and be atomic!</p>
