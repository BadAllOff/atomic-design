	<p>Greetings, reader! The following text is a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-design-book/">work in progress</a> so be warned you will encounter incomplete thoughts, grammar errors, and more. If you see something worth fixing, please <a href="https://github.com/bradfrost/atomic-design">submit an issue on Github</a>. Thanks and happy reading!</p>

    <p>And they made a design system, delivered a pattern library, and lived happily ever after. Right? </p>

<p>Not quite.</p>

<p>There’s a very real risk that a pattern library will be thrown in the trashcan right along with the PSDs, PDFs and other artifacts of the design process. All the time and effort that went into into making a thoughtful design system and pattern library goes down the drain.</p>

<p>Why does this happen?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap &amp; backlog, serving an ecosystem. <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608">Nathan Curtis</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An <em>artifact</em> is something you’d find in an archaeological dig or a museum, whereas a <em>system</em> is a living, breathing, kinetic entity. A pattern library provides helpful documentation, but simply making a pattern library doesn’t guarantee long-term success. Pattern library</p>

<p>We’ve already discussed the importance of resetting everyone’s expectations to create a pattern-driven, more collaborative workflow. In order to make successful, lasting design systems, we must once again fundamentally shift how people think about the work we create.</p>

<p>We <em>think</em> we make websites. And that’s partially true. But the issue with th</p>

<p>With this approach, the website remains the primary focus of attention. The pattern library is an offshoot of the website. But you can almost see that pattern library breaking off and fading into the abyss. This is what tends to happen without a fundamental shift in how we think about our longterm design process.</p>

<p>Rather than .One of the most fundamental shifts in how we think is around what it is we’re building. The website becomes one instantiation of </p>

<h3 id="done-and-done">Done and done</h3>
<p>One essential expectation to reset is the concept of <em>done</em>. Print and other physical mediums involve creating tangible objects that have a sense of finality to them. That simply doesn’t exist in the digital world. The ephemeral nature of the Web means that changes can happen  is something that needs to be extolled to your clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. If we’re to create living design systems, we need to recognize that the Web is never done, and that our work can and should be constantly evolved and improved upon over time.</p>
