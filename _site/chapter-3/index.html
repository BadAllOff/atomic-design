    <div class="note">
	<p>Greetings, reader! The following text is a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-design-book/">work in progress</a> so be warned you will encounter incomplete thoughts, grammar errors, and more. If you see something worth fixing, please <a href="https://github.com/bradfrost/atomic-design">submit an issue on Github</a>. Thanks and happy reading!</p>

    <p>In the last chapter, I introduced the atomic design methodology for constructing user interfaces. Hopefully you’ll find atomic design to be a helpful mental model for constructing UI design systems, but now it’s time to climb down from the ivory tower and actually put atomic design into practice <em>in the real world</em>.</p>

<p>The cornerstone of pattern-based design and development is the pattern library, which serves as a centralized hub of all the UI components that comprise your user interface. As we discussed in Chapter 1, the benefits of pattern libraries are many:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They <strong>promote consistency and cohesion</strong> across the entire experience</li>
  <li>They <strong>speed up your team’s workflow</strong>, saving time and money</li>
  <li>They <strong>establish a more collaborative workflow</strong> between disciplines and vendors.</li>
  <li>They <strong>establish a shared vocabulary</strong> between everyone involved in a project.</li>
  <li>They <strong>provide helpful documentation</strong> to help educate stakeholders, colleagues, and outside vendors.</li>
  <li>They <strong>make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier</strong>.</li>
  <li>They <strong>serve as a future-friendly foundation</strong> for teams to modify, extend, and improve upon over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>That all sounds wonderful, right? I can almost hear you saying, “I need this whole pattern library thing in my life.” But how do we make pattern libraries happen? Well, you’ve come to the right place, friend, because the rest of this book is dedicated to exactly that. This chapter will introduce helpful tools for creating pattern libraries, and the following chapter will discuss how to make pattern-based design and development a key aspect of your workflow. </p>

<p>I’ll be talking about the qualities of effective pattern libraries through the lens of a tool called <a href="http://patternlab.io">Pattern Lab</a>, an open-source project created by <a href="http://dmolsen.com">Dave Olsen</a> and myself in order to execute atomic design systems. While I’ll excitedly discuss Pattern Lab and its various features, I want to stress that the point of this chapter is to cover the characteristics of well-constructed pattern libraries, not sell any one specific tool to you. Hell, Pattern Lab isn’t even for sale! No single tool will be a perfect fit for all readers, but be sure to keep the following principles in mind when deciding what tools to use to create your pattern libraries.</p>

<h2 id="just-what-exactly-is-pattern-lab">Just what exactly is Pattern Lab?</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of how Pattern Lab works, it’s important to take time to explain what the tool is and isn’t.</p>

<h3 id="pattern-lab-is">Pattern Lab is…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a static site generator for building atomic design systems.</li>
  <li>a pattern documentation and annotation tool.</li>
  <li>a pattern starter kit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pattern-lab-isnt">Pattern Lab isn’t…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a UI framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.</li>
  <li>language, library, style, or buzzword dependent.</li>
  <li>a replacement for content management systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s walk through what these points mean, starting with the term <em>static site generator</em>. Static site generator tools take in some source code &amp; assets, compile them, and spit plain-ol’ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript out the other end. <strong>Pattern Lab takes source code – namely patterns – and compiles those patterns into a functional front-end UI inside a pattern library shell</strong>. </p>

<p>So what does Pattern Lab look like? Drumroll, please. </p>

	<figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Not a terribly inspiring design, eh? Believe it or not, this minimal (one may even say “lack of”) design is deliberate. To avoid incorrect classification as a UI framework like Bootstrap, the design is deliberately stripped down so no one would mistakenly use Pattern Lab’s demo UI as a framework. Pattern Lab doesn’t give you any answers as to how to design or architect your front-end code; <em>you have to do all that work yourself.</em> The look &amp; feel, naming conventions, syntax, structure, libraries, and scripts you choose to use to create your UI is entirely up to you. Pattern Lab is just there to help stitch it all together.</p>

<p>In order to understand how the core of Pattern Lab works, all you need to know is how Russian nesting dolls work. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/russian-nesting-dolls.jpg" alt="Russian nesting dolls. &lt;a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/tromal/6901848291/'&gt;via Flickr user Tromal&lt;/a&gt;" />

</figure>

<p>Matryoshka dolls, or Russian nesting dolls, are beautiful-carved, hollow, wooden dolls of increasing size that are placed one inside the other. Patterns in Pattern Lab operate in a similar manner: the smallest patterns (atoms) are included inside bigger patterns (molecules), which are included in even bigger patterns (organisms), which are in turn included in even bigger patterns (templates). </p>

<p>Constructing UIs in this manner helps keeps things DRY, which stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” Make a change to one of the patterns, and anywhere that pattern gets included will magically update with those changes. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Building the final UI and building its underlying design system is one in the same. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-separation-between-structure-and-data">A separation between structure and data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discuss replacing default data with real representative content (mention how the new version of Pattern Lab supports YAML, Markdown, etc in addition to JSON)</li>

</ul>

  <li>It’s more helpful as a client and colleague education tool. Helps them appreciate that you’re creating a user interface that looks and functions great no matter what viewport size </li>
