	<p>Greetings, reader! The following text is a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-design-book/">work in progress</a> so be warned you will encounter incomplete thoughts, grammar errors, and more. If you see something worth fixing, please <a href="https://github.com/bradfrost/atomic-design">submit an issue on Github</a>. Thanks and happy reading!</p>
</div>
    <p>In the last chapter, I introduced the atomic design methodology for constructing user interfaces. Hopefully you’ll find atomic design to be a helpful mental model for constructing UI design systems, but now it’s time to climb down from the ivory tower and actually put atomic design into practice <em>in the real world</em>.</p>

<p>The cornerstone of pattern-based design and development is the pattern library, which serves as a centralized hub of all the UI components that comprise your user interface. As we discussed in Chapter 1, the benefits of pattern libraries are many:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They <strong>promote consistency and cohesion</strong> across the entire experience.</li>
  <li>They <strong>speed up your team’s workflow</strong>, saving time and money.</li>
  <li>They <strong>establish a more collaborative workflow</strong> between all disciplines involved in a project.</li>
  <li>They <strong>establish a shared vocabulary</strong> between everyone in an organization, including outside vendors.</li>
  <li>They <strong>provide helpful documentation</strong> to help educate stakeholders, colleagues, and even third parties.</li>
  <li>They <strong>make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier</strong>.</li>
  <li>They <strong>serve as a future-friendly foundation</strong> for teams to modify, extend, and improve upon over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>That all sounds wonderful, right? I can almost hear you saying, “I need this whole pattern library thing in my life.” But how do we make pattern libraries happen? Well, you’ve come to the right place, friend, because the rest of this book is dedicated to exactly that. This chapter will introduce helpful tools for creating pattern libraries, and the following chapter will discuss how to make patterns a cornerstone of your design and development workflow. </p>

<p>I’ll be talking about the qualities of effective pattern libraries through the lens of a tool called <a href="http://patternlab.io">Pattern Lab</a>, an open-source project created by me and <a href="http://dmolsen.com">Dave Olsen</a> to execute atomic design systems. While I’ll excitedly discuss Pattern Lab and its various features, I want to stress that the point of this chapter is to cover the characteristics of well-constructed pattern libraries, not sell any one specific tool to you. Hell, Pattern Lab isn’t even for sale! No single tool will be a perfect fit for all readers, but be sure to keep the following principles in mind when deciding what tools to use to create your pattern libraries.</p>

<h2 id="just-what-exactly-is-pattern-lab">Just what exactly is Pattern Lab?</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of how Pattern Lab works, it’s important to take time to explain what the tool is and isn’t.</p>

<h3 id="pattern-lab-is">Pattern Lab is…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a static site generator tool for building atomic design systems.</li>
  <li>a pattern documentation and annotation tool.</li>
  <li>a pattern starter kit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pattern-lab-isnt">Pattern Lab isn’t…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a UI framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.</li>
  <li>language, library, or style dependent.</li>
  <li>a replacement for a content management system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s walk through these points, starting with the term <em>static site generator</em>. Static site generator tools take in some source code &amp; assets, compile them, and spit plain-ol’ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript out the other end. <strong>Pattern Lab takes source code – namely patterns – and compiles those patterns into a functional front-end UI inside a pattern library shell</strong>.</p>

<p>So what does Pattern Lab look like out of the box? Drumroll, please. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-default.png" alt="The default Pattern Lab dashboard. What it lacks in good looks, it makes up for in utility." />
	<figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Not a terribly inspiring design, eh? Believe it or not, this minimal (one may even say “lack of”) design is deliberate. To avoid incorrect classification as a UI framework like Bootstrap, the design is deliberately stripped down so no one would mistakenly use Pattern Lab’s demo UI as suggested styles. Pattern Lab doesn’t give you any answers as to how to design or architect your front-end code; <em>you have to do all that work yourself.</em> The look &amp; feel, naming conventions, syntax, structure, libraries, and scripts you choose to use to create your UI is entirely up to you. Heck, you can even use UI frameworks like Bootstrap within Pattern Lab. Pattern Lab is just there to help stitch everything together.</p>

<p>As a technical aside, Pattern Lab uses PHP as the engine that stitches patterns together and generates the pattern library. However, you don’t need to be a PHP wizard to use Pattern Lab any more than you have to know how to build an internal combustion engine in order to drive a car. Moreover, your final website doesn’t have to be built with PHP in order to use the tool, as Pattern Lab’s output is backend-agnostic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But if you’re one of those cool kids who thinks using a PHP-based tool will somehow ruin your reputation, there’s also a <a href="https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node">Node.js version</a> thanks to web developer <a href="http://www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com/">Brian Muenzenmeyer</a>. </p>

<p>If that all sounded like gibberish to you, don’t worry. This chapter focuses on the over-arching features and principles behind Pattern Lab rather than going too far down the technical rabbit hole. You can check out <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html">Pattern Lab’s documentation</a> to dive into the nitty gritty.</p>

<h2 id="building-atomic-design-systems-with-pattern-lab">Building atomic design systems with Pattern Lab</h2>
<p>In order to understand the core concept behind Pattern Lab, you need to understand Russian nesting dolls. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/russian-nesting-dolls.jpg" alt="Russian nesting dolls. &lt;a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/tromal/6901848291/'&gt;via Flickr user Tromal&lt;/a&gt;" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Matryoshka dolls, also known as Russian nesting dolls, are beautifully-carved hollow wooden dolls of increasing size that are placed one inside the other. Patterns in Pattern Lab operate in a similar manner: the smallest patterns (atoms) are included inside bigger patterns (molecules), which are included in even bigger patterns (organisms), which are in turn included in even bigger patterns (templates). </p>

<p>Constructing UIs in this manner helps keeps things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, which is a long-standing computer science principle that stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” Make a change to a pattern, and anywhere that pattern is employed will magically update with those changes. This saves an extraordinary amount of time and grief, and certainly beats the pants off sifting through hundreds of Photoshop documents for every instance of a pattern just to make a simple change.</p>

<p>To make this happen Pattern Lab uses the <em>include</em> feature of <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, a logic-less templating language. Here’s what a Mustache include looks like:</p>

<pre>
<code>
{{&gt; atom-thumbnail }}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is Mustache code, in case the double curly braces (<code>{{}}</code>) that look like little mustaches didn’t give it away. The greater than symbol (<code>&gt;</code>) is Mustache’s way of telling Pattern Lab “hey, I want you to include an atom pattern called “thumbnail”. Pattern Lab will go searching through its folders of patterns to find an atom named “thumbnail”.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-file-structure.png" alt="This is what Pattern Lab's default patterns folder structure looks like. You can name and categorize these folders however you'd like, even removing the labels 'atoms', 'molecules', and 'organisms'. The most important consideration is to establish naming &amp; categorization that is most clear for your team." />

</figure>

<p>Now that we know what an include looks like, let’s put it into practice and take a look at a few patterns from a website I helped make for Time Inc. Here’s one reusable pattern we designed:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-molecule.png" alt="For Time Inc.'s website, we created a basic block pattern consisting of a thumbnail image, headline, and excerpt." />
	<figcaption>
	    For Time Inc.'s website, we created a basic block pattern consisting of a thumbnail image, headline, and excerpt.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This pattern should look fairly familiar. A thumbnail image, headline, and excerpt working together as a single unit is a common pattern found on countless websites. Let’s take a peek behind the curtain to see how this pattern is constructed:</p>

<p><em>[<small>Note from Brad: Forgive the mess with the markup formatting. I need to look into how to properly escape characters and highlight syntax in a way that works for the site but also for the eventual ebook.</small>]</em></p>

<pre>
<code>

\&lt;div class="block-post"\&gt;
    \&lt;a href="{{ url }}"\&gt;
        {{&gt; atoms-thumb }}
        \&lt;h3\&gt;{{ headline }}\&lt;/h3\&gt;
       \&lt;p\&gt;{{ excerpt }}\&lt;/p\&gt;
    \&lt;/a\&gt;
\&lt;/div\&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>You can see we have HTML markup consisting of a wrapper <code>div</code> with a class name of <code>block-post</code>, a link, a Mustache include for the thumbnail image, a <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tag for the headline, and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag for the excerpt. You’ll notice there’s more Mustache code for <code>url</code>, <code>headline</code>, and <code>excerpt</code>, which we’ll use later to dynamically swap in actual content. More on that in a bit.</p>

<p>Now that we have our pattern markup established, we can now include that chunk of code in even bigger patterns using the same include method:</p>

<pre>
<code>
{{&gt; molecules-block-post }}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now let’s move up to more complex organisms like the website’s header, which looks a little something like this:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/organism-timeinc-header.png" alt="The website header consists of fairly common conventions like a logo atom, primary navigation molecule, and a search form molecule." />
	<figcaption>
	    The website header consists of fairly common conventions like a logo atom, primary navigation molecule, and a search form molecule.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When we crack open the hood to look at the header’s markup in Pattern Lab, we see the following:</p>

<pre>
<code>

\&lt;header role="banner"\&gt;
    {{&gt; atoms-logo }}
    {{&gt; molecules-primary-nav }}
    {{&gt; molecules-search }}
\&lt;/header\&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>What’s going on here? Well, we have a basic <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag, and inside that tag we’re including the logo image atom, the primary navigation molecule, and the search form molecule.</p>

<p>And now we can include that relatively complex pattern anywhere we need it.</p>

<pre>
<code>
{{&gt; organisms-header }}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Hopefully by now you can see the Russian nesting dolls taking shape. The smallest atoms are included in bigger molecules, and those molecules get included in even bigger organisms. Now let’s take these components and plug them into a layout. Take the homepage template, for instance:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/template-timeinc-homepage-long.png" alt="The Time Inc. homepage template consists of a few repeatable patterns: a global header, a hero area, a few sections (containing an image, headline, excerpt, and call to action), an area featuring four items, a 'factoid' area, and a global footer." />
	<figcaption>
	    The Time Inc. homepage template consists of a few repeatable patterns: a global header, a hero area, a few sections (containing an image, headline, excerpt, and call to action), an area featuring four items, a 'factoid' area, and a global footer.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Take a quick stroll through the homepage template and you’ll see some pretty standard patterns: a site header at the top, a site footer at the bottom, and a full-screen hero area. You’ll also see a few other patterns repeating themselves throughout the template. </p>

<p>So how does this look in code? As you might expect, it involves more includes!</p>

<pre>
<code>

{{&gt; organisms-header }}
\&lt;main role="main"\&gt;
    {{# hero }}
    {{&gt; molecules-hero }}
    {{/ hero }}
    \&lt;section\&gt;
        {{# experience-hero }}
        {{&gt; molecules-hero-main }}
        {{/ experience-hero }}
        {{# experience-feature }}
        {{&gt; organisms-story-feature }}
        {{/ experience-feature }}
    \&lt;/section\&gt;
    \&lt;section\&gt;
        {{# factoid-advertising }}
        {{&gt; organisms-factoid }}
        {{/ factoid-advertising }}
    \&lt;/section\&gt;
    \&lt;section\&gt;
        {{# advertising }}
        {{&gt; molecules-hero-main }}
        {{/ advertising }}
    \&lt;/section\&gt;
    …   
  \&lt;/main\&gt;
  {{&gt; organisms-footer }}
\&lt;/div\&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>At this stage in the game the smaller patterns are already constructed, so all the template needs to do is pull them into the context of a page layout and give them unique names.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at the code, notice certain patterns like <code>{{&gt; organisms-header }}</code> and <code>{{&gt; organisms-footer }}</code> are included the same way we’ve done with the prior examples. But there are also a few other includes patterns that are supplemented by some additional information, like the following:</p>

<pre>
<code>

{{# factoid-advertising }}
{{&gt; organisms-factoid }}
{{/ factoid-advertising }}

</code>
</pre>

<p>We’re including <code>organisms-factoid</code> the same way as all the other patterns, but we’re also naming it <code>factoid-advertising</code> by wrapping the include in a mustache <em>section</em>, indicated by the mustache code containing the <code>#</code> and <code>/</code> symbols.  By giving the pattern instance a unique name, we can latch onto it and dynamically replace the content of the pattern. More on that in the next section!</p>

<p>This Russian nesting doll approach to building UIs is simple but tremendously powerful. This structure allows designers and developers to keep patterns DRY saving time, effort, and money.  This approach also allows teams to build a final UI while simultaneously creating the underlying UI design system.  After all, the final interface is one instantiation of its underlying design system. Teams can also traverse between abstract and concrete, zeroing in on a particular pattern to fix bugs (“The header’s broken!”), while also seeing how changes to small patterns affect the overall page layout.</p>

<h2 id="a-separation-between-structure-and-data">A separation between structure and data</h2>
<p>It’s important to articulate the underlying content structure of UI patterns within the context of a pattern library. That’s why we’ve been looking at dimension-displaying grayscale images and placeholder text containing character limits. But while this information is helpful for creative teams, grayscale images and lorem ipsum text are not what end users interact with on your actual site. We need a way to replace our default dummy content with real representative content in order to ensure our UI patterns match the reality of the content that lives inside them.</p>

<p>To demonstrate how Pattern Lab dynamically swaps in real content into templates, let’s take a look at a side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.’s homepage template and page levels:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/timeinc-template-page.png" alt="A side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.'s homepage template and page levels. The template articulates the content structure of the design system, while the page demonstrates what the system looks like with real content poured into it." />
