    <p>Talk is cheap. And up until now, we’ve been doing a whole lotta talkin’. That’s not to say it hasn’t been productive talk! After all, we’ve discussed the importance of modular thinking, we’ve learned a methodology for crafting deliberate UI design systems, and we’ve showcased tools for creating effective pattern libraries. </p>

<p>But here’s where the rubber meets the road. Where we roll up our sleeves and put all of this theory into practice. Where we <em>get stuff done</em>. This chapter will tackle all that goes into selling, creating, and maintaining effective design systems. You ready? Let’s go.</p>

<h2 id="its-people">It’s People!</h2>
<p>The not-so-secret secret about creating effective design systems (or doing any great work, really): <strong>it all comes down to people truly collaborating and communicating with each other</strong>.</p>

<p>If this is such common knowledge, why aren’t we constantly hearing thousands of success stories from around the world? I’ll let Mark Boulton explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The design process is weird and complicated, because <em>people</em> are weird and complicated. <cite>Mark Boulton</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can have all the right technologies in place, use the latest-and-greatest tools, and even have extraordinarily talented individuals on board, but if everyone involved isn’t actually cooperating and communicating with each other then you’re not going to create great work. It’s as simple as that. That’s not to say you can’t create <em>good</em> work, but more often than not you’re going to create <em>one of the many disappointing shades of bad</em> work.</p>

<p>Establishing and maintaining successful interface design systems is an organization-wide effort, and this chapter will discuss how to overcome human beings’ many quirks to make them happen. </p>

<h2 id="pitching-patterns">Pitching patterns</h2>
<p>Introducing a new way of doing things is no easy task as it requires changing people’s existing mentalities and behaviors. Getting stakeholders and clients on board with establishing a design system involves constant education, as well as a bit of marketing savvy. </p>

<p>First things first. It’s necessary to introduce the concept of interface design systems to your clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. Explain what these design systems are and the many ways they can help the organization. We’ve discussed these benefits throughout the book, so you can explain that design systems <strong>promote consistency and cohesion</strong>, <strong>speed up your team’s workflow</strong>, <strong>establish a more collaborative workflow</strong>, <strong>establish a shared vocabulary</strong>, <strong>provide helpful documentation</strong>, <strong>make testing easier</strong>, and <strong>serve as a future-friendly foundation</strong>. Who can say no to all that!?</p>

<p>Alas, I’ve found that I can hype design systems until I’m blue in the face, but the suits don’t always see things through the same lens as the people on the ground. A simple reframing of the question helps immensely. I’ve found it much more effective to simply ask, “<strong>Do you like saving time and money, yes or no?</strong>” If the answer to that question is <em>no</em>, I’m afraid you have way bigger problems than selling a design system. If the answer is <em>yes</em>, then you can pitch the benefits through the lens of time and money. Let’s try this out, shall we?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design systems <strong>lead to cohesive, consistent experiences</strong>. That means users master your UI faster, leading to more conversions and <strong>more money</strong>.</li>
  <li>Design systems <strong>speed up your team’s workflow</strong>. Rather than reinventing the wheel every time a new request comes down the pipe, teams can reuse already-established UI puzzle pieces to roll out new pages and features faster than ever before.</li>
  <li>Centralizing UI components in a pattern library <strong>establishes a shared vocabulary</strong> for everyone in the organization and <strong>creates a more collaborative workflow</strong> across all disciplines. With everyone speaking the same language, more time is spent getting work done and less time is spent dealing with superfluous back-and-forth communications and meetings discussing “that thing on the homepage”.</li>
  <li>Design systems <strong>make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier</strong>, vastly speeding up production time and therefore allowing teams to launch more stuff faster. Also, baking things like accessibility into a living design system means less risk of getting sued for inaccessible features.</li>
  <li>Once a design system (with accompanying pattern library) is established, it <strong>serves as a future-friendly foundation</strong> for the organization to modify, tweak, extend, and improve upon over time. Doing some AB testing? Roll the learnings from those tests into the living design system! Made some big performance optimizations? Roll them into the living design system! The <em>living</em> part of living design systems means they can always adapt to meet the future needs of the organization, saving time and money all the while.</li>
</ul>

<p>Framing things through the lens of time and money helps the people controlling the pursestrings understand why a design system is a worthwhile pursuit. With any luck, these conversations will translate to a concrete commitment from the organization (read: allocating real time and money) to make a design system happen.</p>

<h2 id="show-dont-tell-interface-inventories">Show, don’t tell: interface inventories</h2>
<p>If only getting buy-in were as easy as having a few well-timed conversations with the right people. Maybe you’re savvy enough to seal the deal with talking points alone, but for us mere mortals words aren’t enough. Sometimes you need to need more. Sometimes you need to make them <em>feel the pain</em>.</p>

<p>Enter the interface inventory.</p>

<p>Many are familiar with the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_inventory">content inventory</a>. Content audits are usually performed in the early stages of a website redesign process to take stock of all a site’s content. It’s a tedious process involving spreadsheets and caffeine, but all that hard work pays off. By the end of the exercise the organization’s content is laid out on the table, giving teams valuable insights in how to tackle their project.  </p>

<p>An interface inventory is similar to a content inventory, only instead of sifting through and categorizing content, you’re taking stock and categorizing the components making up your user interface. <strong>An interface inventory is a comprehensive collection of the bits and pieces that make up your interface</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="conducting-an-interface-audit">Conducting an interface audit</h3>
<p>So how do you go about conducting an interface audit? How do you go about rounding up all the components that make up your UI? While an interface inventory is essentially a whole lot of screenshots, there are some key considerations to keep in mind to make the exercise a success.</p>

<h4 id="step-1-round-up-the-troops">Step 1: round up the troops</h4>
<p>I’ve encountered many ambitious designers or developers who have taken it upon themselves to start documenting the organization’s UI patterns. While I certainly applaud this individual ambition, <strong>it’s absolutely essential to get all members of the team to experience the pain of an inconsistent UI and start thinking systematically</strong>.</p>

<p>In order for the interface inventory to be as fruitful as possible, <strong>representatives from all disciplines responsible for the success of the site should be in a room together</strong> for the exercise. Round up the troops: designers, front-end developers, back-end developers, copywriters, content strategists, project managers, business owners, QA, and any other stakeholder. The more the merrier! After all, one of the most crucial results of this exercise is to establish a shared vocabulary for everyone in the organization, and that requires input from everyone.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-prepare-for-screenshotting">Step 2: prepare for screenshotting</h4>
<p>The interface inventory exercise generates a ton of screenshots, so naturally you’ll need screenshotting software like the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Powerpoint or Keynote</li>
  <li>Photoshop or Sketch</li>
  <li>Evernote web clipper</li>
  <li>Google Docs or Microsoft Word</li>
  <li>Google Slides (If you’re interested, I’ve created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GqFmiDV_NqKi36fXAwD3WTJL5-JV-gHL7XVD2fVeL0M/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slides template</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter what tool you use, but everyone should agree on a single tool to make it easier to combine at the end of the exercise. I’ve found online slide-building software like Google Slides to be most effective as they provide a canvas for freeform positioning of images, they’re chunked out into slides for better categorization, and they’re web-based so can be shared with ease.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-screenshot-exercise">Step 3: screenshot exercise</h4>
<p>Get your screenshotting fingers ready because it’s time for the main event! <strong>The interface inventory exercise involves screenshotting, naming, and categorizing all the unique UI patterns that make up your experience</strong>. Bear in mind this exercise doesn’t mean capturing <em>every instance</em> of a UI pattern, but rather capturing one instance of each unique UI pattern.</p>

<p>Assign each participant a UI category. Depending on how many people are participating, you may need to break people up into pairs or have participants document multiple categories. Again, the more the merrier, as more people screenshotting will result in more thorough documentation.</p>

<p>So what categories of interface elements should be captured? Obviously the interface element categories are going to vary from experience to experience, but here’s a few categories to start with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global elements</strong> – components like headers, footers, and other global elements that are shared across the entire experience</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong> – primary navigation, footer navigation, pagination, breadcrumbs, interactive component controls, and essentially anything that’s used to navigate around a user interface</li>
  <li><strong>Image types</strong> – Logos, hero images, avatars, thumbnails, backgrounds, etc and any other unique image pattern that shows up in the UI. </li>
  <li><strong>Icons</strong> – Icons are a special type of image worthy of their own category. Capture magnifying glasses, social icons, arrows, hamburgers, spinners, favicons, and every other interface icon.</li>
  <li><strong>Forms</strong> – Inputs, text areas, select menus, checkboxes, switches, radio buttons, sliders, and other forms of user input</li>
  <li><strong>Buttons</strong> – Buttons are the quintessential UI element. Capture all the unique button patterns throughout an experience: primary, secondary, big, small, disabled, active, loading, and even buttons that look more like text links.</li>
  <li><strong>Headings</strong> – h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 and variations of typographic headings. </li>
  <li>“<strong>Blocks</strong>” – Also known as touts, callouts, summaries, ads, or hero units, “blocks” are collections of typographic headings and/or images and/or summary text (see Nicole Sullivan’s write-up about the <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/">Media Object</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Lists</strong> – Round up unordered, ordered, definition, bulleted, numbered, lined, striped, or any group of elements presented in a list-type format.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Components</strong> – Accordions, tabs, carousels, and other modules with moving parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Media</strong> – Video players, audio players and other rich media elements.</li>
  <li><strong>3rd Party</strong> – Widgets, iframes, stock tickers, social buttons,  <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/surfacing-invisible-elements/">invisible tracking scripts</a>, and anything else that isn’t hosted on your domain.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising</strong> – Document all ad formats and dimensions.</li>
  <li><strong>Messaging</strong> – Alerts, success, errors, warnings, errors, validation, in-progress, popups, tooltips, etc. This is a challenging category to capture as these messages often require user action to expose.</li>
  <li><strong>Colors</strong> – Capture all unique colors presented in the interface. This category can be aided by fantastic style-guide bootstrapping tools like <a href="http://cssstats.com/">CSS Stats</a> and <a href="http://stylifyme.com/">Stylify Me</a></li>
  <li><strong>Animation</strong> – Animation is an elemental aspect of user interfaces, and should therefore be documented. This requires using screen recording software such as Quicktime to capture motion </li>
</ul>

<p>I try to timebox the screenshotting exercise to avoid going down a rabbit hole that ends up lasting all day. The amount of time to allocate will vary depending on how many people are participating, but I find between 30-90 minutes to be sufficient for a first pass of the interface inventory.</p>

<p>These categories aren’t set in stone and will vary based on the nature of the type of user interface. Once these patterns are documented the person (or pair of people) should drop them into  Google Slides and cluster them together. Now the fun part: naming these patterns. Obviously it’s important to use existing conventions wherever possible, but you’ll quickly find out many UI patterns either don’t have names or have conflicting/confusing names.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-present-findings">Step 4: present findings</h4>
<p>Screenshotting and naming can be exhausting and overwhelming, so be sure to take a break after the gathering exercise is complete. Get some food, grab some coffee, and stretch your legs.</p>

<p>Once everyone’s recharged, reconvene and spend about 10-15 minutes per category presenting the findings to the group. This is where things get interesting. Presenting to the group allows the team to start discussing the naming conventions and rationale for these UI patterns.  As I do more of these exercises with teams, it’s fascinating to hear that designers, developers, and product owners often have different names for the same UI pattern.</p>

<p>Once every category has been presented and discussed, have all the participants send their slides to the exercise leader, who merges everything into one uber-document.</p>

<h4 id="step-5-pegroup-and-establish-next-steps">Step 5: pegroup and establish next steps</h4>
<p>The hard work is done, so now what? This exercise should be used as a conversation starter to get the entire organization on board with crafting an interface design system.</p>

<p>The uber-document can be shopped around to stakeholders to get buy in for establishing an interface design system. The beautiful thing about seeing all the disparities of an interface laid bare for everyone to see is that it becomes crystal clear something needs done about it.</p>

<p>In addition to selling the idea through, the interface inventory should be used as the groundwork for a future pattern library. Gather a smaller cross-disciplinary team together to go through the uber-document and have some conversations about it. Some important questions for this group to cover:</p>

<p>What names should we settle on?
What patterns should stay, and which should go?
Can we merge patterns together easily?
How do developers, designers, and managers begin to utilize this shared vocabulary?
How do we translate this exercise into a living pattern library?</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-an-interface-inventory">Benefits of an Interface Inventory</h3>
<p>Why go through all the trouble of deconstructing and cataloging an interface? It’s certainly a tedious process, but the results are extremely beneficial. Here are just some of the benefits of an interface inventory:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lays the groundwork to a sound design system</strong>—Creating systematic, atomic, styleguide-driven design is a smart strategy, and an interface inventory is that first step at deconstructing pages down to their atomic level. Eventually the interface inventory can be used to help set up a style guide or pattern library.</li>
  <li><strong>Convince your boss/client/organization</strong> that establishing a cohesive design system is essential. This is especially true for large organizations consisting of many teams or working with multiple 3rd party agencies. An interface inventory is the first step toward establishing a common interface language.</li>
  <li><strong>Promote consistency</strong>—Displaying a plethora of similar-but-still-different treatments next to each other exposes redundancy and underscores the need to create a consistent, cohesive experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensures all interface components are accounted for</strong>—This happens a lot. A full-on redesign is underway, and somewhere along the line certain modules end up slipping between the cracks. Creating an interface inventory up front helps establish project scope and ensures that all components are accounted for so there are no nasty surprises at the 11th hour before launch.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Retrofitting</strong>—While mobile-first responsive design is certainly a preferred approach to responsive design, it’s not always feasible to undertake right away. Budget, time, scope, skillset, and more often force organizations to retrofit their existing website into a responsive site. Creating an interface inventory allows design teams to analyze the interface in order to establish what components will be easy and relatively difficult to convert into a responsive environment.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="interface-inventories-in-action">Interface Inventories In Action</h4>
<p>I went through just a few pages of my bank’s website and screen grabbed all the various button variations I could find. Here’s the result:</p>

<p>As you can see, their button styles are all over the place and are about the furthest thing from consistent and cohesive. Looking closer at the buttons reveal incredible inconsistency in gradient, arrow, border and more:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-code.png" alt="" />
	<figcaption>
	    
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now contrast these styles with a button interface inventory for Etsy, a company who maintains a robust styleguide and pattern library:</p>

<p>It’s not to say that deviating from established patterns is always a bad idea, but it’s important to recognize the difference between intentional and unintentional deviation. An interface inventory helps expose unintentional inconsistencies and encourages consistent, deliberate design decisions.</p>

<p>In order to present your product or service in a cohesive and consistent manner across a slew of properties, browsers, devices, and environments, it’s essential to take stock of what your interface is composed of. Documenting unique UI patterns highlights inconsistencies and sets the stage for a broader conversation about establishing a pattern-based workflow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Even if they say no, do it anyways. Much like building in performance and accessibility and responsiveness into our experiences</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-to-establish-a-pattern-library">When to establish a pattern library</h3>
<p>Interface design systems and their accompanying pattern libraries are often done in conjunction with a new design or redesign project, replatforming effort, some other project. Piggybacking off another effort is a great way to sneak a pattern library project into your organization.</p>

<p>But establishing a pattern library doesn’t necessarily need to be attached to another project. If you can convince your clients and bosses to pony up the cash and resources to make things happen, then good on you! </p>
