In the last chapter, I introduced the atomic design methodology for constructing user interfaces. Hopefully you'll find atomic design to be a helpful mental model for constructing UI design systems, but now it's time to climb down from the ivory tower and actually put atomic design into practice *in the real world*.

The cornerstone of pattern-based design and development is the pattern library, which serves as a centralized hub of all the UI components that comprise your user interface. As we discussed in Chapter 1, the benefits of pattern libraries are many:

- They **promote consistency and cohesion** across the entire experience
- They **speed up your team's workflow**, saving time and money
- They **establish a more collaborative workflow** between disciplines and vendors.
- They **establish a shared vocabulary** between everyone involved in a project.
- They **provide helpful documentation** to help educate stakeholders, colleagues, and outside vendors.
- They **make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier**.
- They **serve as a future-friendly foundation** for teams to modify, extend, and improve upon over time.

That all sounds wonderful, right? I can almost hear you saying, "I need this whole pattern library thing in my life." But how do we make pattern libraries happen? Well, you've come to the right place, friend, because this chapter will introduce helpful tools for creating pattern libraries. 

I'll be talking about the qualities of effective pattern libraries through the lens of a tool called [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io), an open-source project created by [Dave Olsen](http://dmolsen.com) and myself in order to execute atomic design systems. While I'll excitedly discuss Pattern Lab and its various features, I want to stress that the point of this chapter is to cover the characteristics of well-constructed pattern libraries, not promote any one specific tool. No single tool will be a perfect fit for all readers, so be sure to keep the the following principles and features in mind when deciding what tools to use to create your pattern libraries.

## What is Pattern Lab?
[Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io)

### What Pattern Lab is
- Design builder builder - static site generator, integrated tool for creating production-ready front-end UIs
- End goal being the comprehensive component library 
- Pattern documentation tool
- Annotation tool
- Pattern starter kit
- Viewport resizer

### What Pattern Lab isn't
- A UI framework like Bootstrap or Foundation (in fact, these frameworks can be used inside Pattern Lab)
- Language, library, or style dependent
- Incredibly rigid - you can bulldoze the entire atomic design labels, etc
- “Just” a pattern library, but also not a production-ready static site generator that's going to replace your CMS.

### Atomic design system builder
- Demonstrate how patterns get included inside other patterns
- Discuss replacing default data with real representative content (mention how the new version of Pattern Lab supports YAML, Markdown, etc in addition to JSON)

### Viewport tools for flexible patterns
- The importance of flexible patterns
- The dangers of focusing on popular device dimensions
- Ish
- Disco mode
- It's helpful for designers and developers to see where there might be 
- It's more helpful as a client and colleague education tool. Helps them appreciate that you're creating a user interface that looks and functions great no matter what viewport size 

### Code View
- A good pattern library allows teams to look under the hood to see the source code. HTML, CSS, JS, template code

### Annotations
- Annotation tool - the issue tool
- Documentation tools

### Pattern Lineage

### More tools
