This chapter will discuss tools and techniques to create atomic design systems. I'll introduce Pattern Lab, a tool Dave Olsen and I created in order to execute atomic design systems. I'll explain the gist of using Pattern Lab and its various features, but I want to be cognizant of not focusing too much on this specific tool. While I know it's an effective tool for me and others, I understand that it might not be a perfect fit for all readers. The book is more about promoting the idea of atomic design rather than any specific tool.
