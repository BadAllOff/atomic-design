This book is dedicated to my amazing wife __Melissa__ who supports all of my crazy ideas and somehow finds a way to put up with all of my shit. Thank you. I love you.

I'd like to give a massive thank you to __Dave Olsen__ who took my nascent, poorly-programmed [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io) concept and transformed it into a legit and amazing piece of software. Thanks to the tireless work of Dave and __Brian Muenzenmeyer__, Pattern Lab is helping teams all over the world create atomic design systems. I'm forever grateful for all of your superb work, and consider myself fortunate to call you friends.

To __Josh Clark__, __Jennifer Brook__, __Dan Mall__, __Jonathan Stark__, __Robert Gorrell__, __Kelly Shaver__, and __Melissa Frost__ for helping solidify atomic design as a methodology and Pattern Lab as a tool. You trusted me enough to run with this approach and somehow convinced our clients it wasn't totally insane. This book wouldn't have been possible without your input and smarts throughout the projects we worked on together.

To __Anna Debenham__ for all your amazing thinking about front end style guides, your [book](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/) on the topic, and your willingness to co-host a podcast all about style guides with me. I'm proud of the work we've done on [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/) and am so happy we got to work together.

To **Stephen Hay**, who was the first person I heard articulate the need to break interfaces into smaller pieces. Thanks for being a continued source of wisdom and sarcasm.

To __Andy Clarke__, who was talking about design systems and  [atoms](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/an-extract-from-designing-atoms-and-elements) before it was the hip thing to do. Thank you for all your writing and thinking, but you're still not getting my dog.

To Dave "Tiny Bootstraps" Rupert, Susan Robertson, Samantha Warren, Jina Bolton, Nathan Curtis, Paul Robert Lloyd, Harry Roberts, Jonathan Snook, Nicole Sullivan, Brett Jankord, Tyler Sticka, Lincoln Mongillo, Nicholas Gallagher and the many others who have advanced the concepts of design systems, pattern libraries, and style guides. Thanks for helping me and so many others think more modularly.

To Jeffrey Zeldman, Eric Meyer, Marc Thiele, Vitaly Friedman, and all the other conference organizers who let me stumble onto their stages to ramble on about the concepts contained in this book.

This book would not have been possible if it weren't for the amazing work done by some amazing people in the Web community. I'm so incredibly fortunate to work in such an open and sharing community, and every day I look forward to learning new things from you all.

And last but certainly not least, thanks so much to my family for all your love and support over the years.
