This book is dedicated to my amazing wife __Melissa__ who supports all of my crazy ideas and somehow finds a way to put up with all of my shit. Thank you. I love you.

This book would not have been possible if it weren't for the amazing work done by some amazing people in the Web community. I'm so incredibly fortunate to work in such an open and sharing community, and every day I look forward to learning new things from you all.

I'd like to give a *massive* thank you to __Dave Olsen__ who took my nascent, poorly-programmed [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io) concept and transformed it into an amazing piece of software that's now used by people all over the world. I'm forever grateful for all of your superb work, and consider myself fortunate to call you a friend.

To __Josh Clark__, __Jennifer Brook__, __Dan Mall__, __Jonathan Stark__, __Robert Gorrell__, __Kelly Shaver__, and __Melissa Frost__ for helping solidify atomic design as a methodology and Pattern Lab as a tool. This project wouldn't have been possible without your input and smarts throughout the projects we worked on together.

To __Andy Clarke__, who's been talking about design systems and  [atoms](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/an-extract-from-designing-atoms-and-elements) way before it was the hip thing to do. Your writing and thinking have always been an inspiration to me, so thank you. But you're not getting my dog.

To __Anna Debenham__ for all your amazing thinking about front end style guides and your [book](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/) on the topic. And thanks for making  [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/) the one-stop resource for all things style guide related.

To Dave "Tiny Bootstraps" Rupert, Susan Robertson, Samantha Warren, Brett Jankord, Tyler Sticka, Lincoln Mongillo, Paul Robert Lloyd, Harry Roberts, Jonathan Snook, Nicole Sullivan, Nicholas Gallagher and the many others who have helped me think more modularly.
